        The scatterplot below shows the relationship between year and price
        (in thousands of $)
        of a random sample of 42 pickup trucks.
        Also shown is a residuals plot for the linear model for predicting price from year.

    This chapter focused on describing the linear association between two numerical variables and fitting a linear model.
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          The <em>correlation coefficient</em>,
            <idx><h>correlation|textbf</h></idx>
          <m>r</m>, measures the strength and direction of the linear association between two variables.
          However, <m>r</m> alone cannot tell us whether data follow a linear trend or whether a linear model is appropriate.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The <term>explained variance</term>, <m>R^2</m>,
          measures the proportion of variation in the <m>y</m> values explained by a given model.
          Like <m>r</m>,
          <m>R^2</m> alone cannot tell us whether data follow a linear trend or whether a linear model is appropriate.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Every analysis should begin with <em>graphing</em>
          the data using a <term>scatterplot</term>
          in order to see the association and any deviations from the trend
          (outliers or influential values).
          A <em>residual plot</em> helps us better see patterns in the data.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          When the data show a linear trend,
          we fit a <em>least squares regression line</em> of the form:
          <m>\hat{y} = a+bx</m>,
          where <m>a</m> is the <m>y</m>-intercept and <m>b</m> is the slope.
          It is important to be able to <em>calculate</em>
          <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> using the summary statistics and to <em>interpret</em>
          them in the context of the data.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          A <em>residual</em>, <m>y-\hat{y}</m>,
          measures the error for an <em>individual point</em>.
          The <em>standard deviation of the residuals</em>,
          <m>s</m>, measures the typical size of the residuals.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <m>\hat{y} = a+bx</m> provides the best fit line for the <em>observed data</em>.
          To estimate or hypothesize about the slope of the population regression line,
          first confirm that the residual plot has no pattern and that a linear model is reasonable,
          then use a <em><m>t</m>-interval for the slope</em><idx><h>t-interval for the slope@<m>t</m>-interval for the slope|textbf</h></idx> or a
          <em><m>t</m>-test for the slope</em><idx><h>t-test for the slope@<m>t</m>-test for the slope|textbf</h></idx> with <m>n-2</m> degrees of freedom.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    In this chapter we focused on simple linear models with one explanatory variable.
    More complex methods of prediction,
    such as multiple regression
    (more than one explanatory variable)
    and nonlinear regression can be studied in a future course.
