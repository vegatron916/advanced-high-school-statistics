      How do we visualize and summarize categorical data?
      In this section,
      we will introduce tables and other basic tools for categorical data that are used throughout this book and will answer the following questions:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            Based on the <c>loan50</c> data,
            is there an assocation between the categorical variables of homeownership and application type (individual, joint)?
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Using the <c>email50</c> data,
            does email type provide any useful value in classifying email as spam or not spam?
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

          Use a one-way table and a bar<nbsp/>chart to summarize a categorical variable.
          Use counts (frequency) or proportions
          (relative frequency).
        </p>

      <li>
        <p>
          Compare distributions of a categorical variable using a two-way table and a side-by-side bar<nbsp/>chart,
          segmented bar<nbsp/>chart, or mosaic plot.
        </p>

    <p>
      <xref ref="loan_home_app_type_totals">Figure</xref>
      summarizes two variables: <c>app_type</c> and <c>homeownership</c>.
      A table that summarizes data for two categorical variables in this way is called a
      <term>contingency table</term>.
      Each value in the table represents the number of times a particular combination of variable outcomes occurred.
      For example,
      the value 3496 corresponds to the number of loans in the data set where the borrower rents their home and the application type was by an individual.
      Row and column totals are also included.
      The <term>row totals</term> <idx><h>contingency table</h><h>row totals</h></idx> provide the total counts across each row (e.g.
      <m>\loanapphomeAA{} + \loanapphomeAB{} + \loanapphomeAC{} = \loanapphomeAD{}</m>),
      and <term>column totals</term> <idx><h>contingency table</h><h>column totals</h></idx> are total counts down each column.
      We can also create a table that shows only the overall percentages or proportions for each combination of categories,
      or we can create a table for a single variable,
      such as the one shown in <xref ref="loan_homeownership_totals">Figure</xref>
      for the <c>homeownership</c> variable.

    <title>Row and column proportions</title>
    <p>
      Sometimes it is useful to understand the fractional breakdown of one variable in another,
      and we can modify our contingency table to provide such a view.
      <xref ref="rowPropAppTypeHomeownership">Figure</xref>
      shows the <em>row proportions</em><idx><h>contingency table</h><h>row proportions|textbf</h></idx> for <xref ref="loan_home_app_type_totals">Figure</xref>,
      which are computed as the counts divided by their row totals.
      The value 3496 at the intersection of <c>individual</c> and <c>rent</c> is replaced by <m>\loanapphomeAA{}/\loanapphomeAD{} = 0.411</m>,
      i.e. 3496 divided by its row total, 8505.
      So what does 0.411 represent?
      It corresponds to the proportion of individual applicants who rent.

      A contingency table of the column proportions is computed in a similar way,
      where each <em>column proportion</em><idx><h>contingency table</h><h>column proportion|textbf</h></idx> is computed as the count divided by the corresponding column total.
      <xref ref="colPropAppTypeHomeownership">Figure</xref> shows such a table,
      and here the value 0.906 indicates that 90.6% of renters applied as individuals for the loan.
      This rate is higher compared to loans from people with mortgages (80.2%) or who own their home (85.1%).
      Because these rates vary between the three levels of <c>homeownership</c> (<c>rent</c>, <c>mortgage</c>, <c>own</c>), this provides evidence that the <c>app_type</c> and <c>homeownership</c> variables are associated.

      <statement>
        <p>
          Data scientists use statistics to filter spam from incoming email messages.
          By noting specific characteristics of an email,
          a data scientist may be able to classify some emails as spam or not spam with high accuracy.
          One such characteristic is whether the email contains no numbers,
          small numbers, or big numbers.
          Another characteristic is the email format,
          which indicates whether or not an email has any HTML content,
          such as bolded text.
          We'll focus on email format and spam status using the <c>email</c> data set,
          and these variables are summarized in a contingency table in <xref ref="emailSpamHTMLTableTotals">Figure</xref>.
          Which would be more helpful to someone hoping to classify email as spam or regular email for this table:
          row or column proportions?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <answer>
        <p>
          A data scientist would be interested in how the proportion of spam changes within each email format.
          This corresponds to column proportions:
          the proportion of spam in plain text emails and the proportion of spam in HTML emails.
        </p>
        <p>
          If we generate the column proportions,
          we can see that a higher fraction of plain text emails are spam (<m>209/1195 = 17.5\%</m>) than compared to HTML emails
          (<m>158/2726 = 5.8\%</m>).
          This information on its own is insufficient to classify an email as spam or not spam,
          as over 80% of plain text emails are not spam.
          Yet, when we carefully combine this information with many other characteristics,
          we stand a reasonable chance of being able to classify some emails as spam or not spam with confidence.

      Before settling on one form for a table,
      it is important to consider each to ensure that the most useful table is constructed.
      However, sometimes it simply isn't clear which,

          None that we thought were obvious!
          What is distinct about <c>app_type</c> and <c>homeownership</c> vs the email example is that these two variables don't have a clear explanatory-response variable relationship that we might hypothesize
          (see <xref ref="explanatoryAndResponse">Section</xref> for these terms).
          Usually it is most useful to
          <q>condition</q>
          on the explanatory variable.
          For instance, in the email example,
          the email format was seen as a possible explanatory variable of whether the message was spam,
          so we would find it more interesting to compute the relative frequencies (proportions) for each email format.

    <title>Using a bar<nbsp/>chart with two variables</title>
    <p>
      Contingency tables using row or column proportions are especially useful for examining how two categorical variables are related.
      Segmented bar<nbsp/>charts provide a way to visualize the information in these tables.
    </p>
    <p>
      A <em>segmented bar<nbsp/>chart</em>,
          <idx><h>bar chart</h><h>segmented|textbf</h></idx>
      or stacked bar<nbsp/>chart,
      is a graphical display of contingency table information.
      For example,
      a<nbsp/>segmented bar<nbsp/>chart representing <xref ref="colPropAppTypeHomeownership">Figure</xref>
      is shown in <xref ref="loan_app_type_home_seg_bar">Figure</xref>,
      where we have first created a bar<nbsp/>chart using the <c>homeownership</c> variable and then divided each group by the levels of <c>app_type</c> .
    </p>
    <p>
      One related visualization to the segmented bar<nbsp/>chart is the
      <em>side-by-side bar<nbsp/>chart</em>,
          <idx><h>bar chart</h><h>side-by-side|textbf</h></idx>
      where an example is shown in <xref ref="loan_app_type_home_sbs_bar">Figure</xref>.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the last type of bar<nbsp/>chart we introduce,
      the column proportions for the <c>app_type</c> and <c>homeownership</c> contingency table have been translated into a standardized segmented bar<nbsp/>chart in <xref ref="loan_app_type_home_seg_bar_standardized">Figure</xref>.
      This type of visualization is helpful in understanding the fraction of individual or joint loan applications for borrowers in each level of <c>homeownership</c>.
      Additionally,
      since the proportions of <c>joint</c> and <c>individual</c> vary across the groups,
      we can conclude that the two variables are associated.

        <p>
          Examine the four bar<nbsp/>charts in <xref ref="loan_app_type_home_seg_bar_plot">Figure</xref>.
          When is the segmented, side-by-side,
          standardized segmented bar<nbsp/>chart,
          or standardized side-by-side the most useful?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <answer>
        <p>
          The segmented bar<nbsp/>chart is most useful when it's reasonable to assign one variable as the explanatory variable and the other variable as the response,
          since we are effectively grouping by one variable first and then breaking it down by the others.
        </p>
        <p>
          Side-by-side bar<nbsp/>charts are more agnostic in their display about which variable, if any,
          represents the explanatory and which the response variable.
          It is also easy to discern the number of cases in of the six different group combinations.
          However, one downside is that it tends to require more horizontal space;
          the narrowness of <xref ref="loan_app_type_home_sbs_bar">Figure</xref>
          makes the plot feel a bit cramped.
          Additionally, when two groups are of very different sizes,
          as we see in the <c>own</c> group relative to either of the other two groups,
          it is difficult to discern if there is an association between the variables.
        </p>
        <p>
          The standardized segmented bar<nbsp/>chart is helpful if the primary variable in the segmented bar<nbsp/>chart is relatively imbalanced,
          e.g. the <c>own</c> category has only a third of the observations in the <c>mortgage</c> category,
          making the simple segmented bar<nbsp/>chart less useful for checking for an association.
          The major downside of the standardized version is that we lose all sense of how many cases each of the bars represents.
        </p>
        <p>
          The last plot is a standardized side-by-side bar chart.
          It shows the joint and individual groups as proportions within each level of homeownership,
          and it offers similar benefits and tradeoffs to the standardized version of the stacked bar plot.

    <title>Mosaic plots</title>
    <p>
      A <term>mosaic plot</term> is a visualization technique suitable for contingency tables that resembles a standardized segmented bar<nbsp/>chart with the benefit that we still see the relative group sizes of the primary variable as well.
    </p>
    <p>
      To get started in creating our first mosaic plot,
      we'll break a square into columns for each category of the <c>homeownership</c> variable,
      with the result shown in <xref ref="loan_home_mosaic">Figure</xref>.
      Each column represents a level of <c>homeownership</c>,
      and the column widths correspond to the proportion of loans in each of those categories.
      For<nbsp/>instance,
      there are fewer loans where the borrower is an owner than where the borrower has a mortgage.
      In general, mosaic plots use box <em>areas</em>
      to represent the number of cases in each category.
    </p>
    <figure xml:id="loan_home_mosaic">

      plot for <c>homeownership</c>.

      plot for both <c>homeownership</c>
      and <c>app_type</c>.</caption>

      {loan_app_type_home_mosaic_plot}
      {loan_app_type_home_mosaic} }
    </figure>
    <p>
      To create a completed mosaic plot,
      the single-variable mosaic plot is further divided into pieces in <xref ref="loan_app_type_home_mosaic">Figure</xref>
      using the <c>app_type</c> variable.
      Each column is split proportional to the number of loans from individual and joint borrowers.
      For example,
      the second column represents loans where the borrower has a mortgage,
      and it was divided into individual loans (upper) and joint loans
      (lower).
      As another example,
      the bottom segment of the third column represents loans where the borrower owns their home and applied jointly,
      while the upper segment of this column represents borrowers who are homeowners and filed individually.
      We can again use this plot to see that the <c>homeownership</c> and <c>app_type</c> variables are associated,
      since some columns are divided in different vertical locations than others,
      which was the same technique used for checking an association in the standardized segmented bar<nbsp/>chart.
    </p>
    <p>
      In <xref ref="loan_app_type_home_mosaic_rev">Figure</xref>,
      we chose to first split by the homeowner status of the borrower.
      However, we could have instead first split by the application type,
      as in <xref ref="loan_app_type_home_mosaic_rev">Figure</xref>.
      Like with the bar<nbsp/>charts,
      it's common to use the explanatory variable to represent the first split in a mosaic plot,
      and then for the response to break up each level of the explanatory variable,
      if these labels are reasonable to attach to the variables under consideration.

      A <term>pie chart</term> is shown in <xref ref="loan_homeownership_pie_chart">Figure</xref>
      alongside a bar<nbsp/>chart representing the same information.
      Pie charts can be useful for giving a high-level overview to show how a set of cases break down.
      However, it is also difficult to decipher details in a pie chart.
      For example,
      it takes a couple seconds longer to recognize that there are more loans where the borrower has a mortgage than rent when looking at the pie chart,
      while this detail is very obvious in the bar<nbsp/>chart.
      While pie charts can be useful,
      we prefer bar<nbsp/>charts for their ease in comparing groups.
