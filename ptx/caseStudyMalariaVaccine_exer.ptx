    <title>Side effects of Avandia</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Rosiglitazone is the active ingredient in the controversial type<nbsp/>2 diabetes medicine Avandia and has been linked to an increased risk of serious cardiovascular problems such as stroke,
        heart failure,
        and death.
        A common alternative treatment is pioglitazone,
        the active ingredient in a diabetes medicine called Actos.
        In a nationwide retrospective observational study of 227,571 Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 years or older,
        it was found that 2,593 of the 67,593 patients using rosiglitazone and 5,386 of the 159,978 using pioglitazone had serious cardiovascular problems.
        These data are summarized in the contingency table below. \footfullcite{Graham:2010}

            Determine if each of the following statements is true or false.
            If false, explain why.
            <em>Be careful:</em> The reasoning may be wrong even if the statement's conclusion is correct.
            In such cases, the statement should be considered false.
            <task>
              Since more patients on pioglitazone had cardiovascular problems (5,386 vs. 2,593), we can conclude that the rate of cardiovascular problems for those on a pioglitazone treatment is higher.
            </task>
            <task>
              The data suggest that diabetic patients who are taking rosiglitazone are more likely to have cardiovascular problems since the rate of incidence was (2,593 / 67,593 = 0.038) 3.8% for patients on this treatment, while it was only (5,386 / 159,978 = 0.034) 3.4% for patients on pioglitazone.
            </task>
            <task>
              The fact that the rate of incidence is higher for the rosiglitazone group proves that rosiglitazone causes serious cardiovascular problems.
            </task>
            <task>
              Based on the information provided so far, we cannot tell if the difference between the rates of incidences is due to a relationship between the two variables or due to chance.

            We can investigate the relationship between outcome and treatment in this study using a randomization technique.
            While in reality we would carry out the simulations required for randomization using statistical software,
            suppose we actually simulate using index cards.
            In order to simulate from the independence model,
            which states that the outcomes were independent of the treatment,
            we write whether or not each patient had a cardiovascular problem on cards,
            shuffled all the cards together,
            then deal them into two groups of size 67,593 and 159,978.
            We repeat this simulation 1,000 times and each time record the number of people in the rosiglitazone group who had cardiovascular problems.
            Use the relative frequency histogram of these counts to answer (i)-(iii).

    <title>Heart transplants</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        The Stanford University Heart Transplant Study was conducted to determine whether an experimental heart transplant program increased lifespan.
        Each patient entering the program was designated an official heart transplant candidate,
        meaning that he was gravely ill and would most likely benefit from a new heart.
        Some patients got a transplant and some did not.
        The variable <c>transplant</c> indicates which group the patients were in;
        patients in the treatment group got a transplant and those in the control group did not.
        Of the 34 patients in the control group, 30 died.
        Of the 69 people in the treatment group, 45 died.
        Another variable called <c>survived</c> was used to indicate whether or not the patient was alive at the end of the study. \footfullcite{Turnbull+Brown+Hu:1974} <image width="48%" source="images/randomization_heart_transplants_mosaic.png" /> <image width="48%" source="images/randomization_heart_transplants_box.png" />
        <ol>

            <p>
              Based on the mosaic plot,
              is survival independent of whether or not the patient got a transplant?
              Explain your reasoning.

              One approach for investigating whether or not the treatment is effective is to use a randomization technique.
              <task>
                What are the claims being tested?
              </task>
              <task>
                The paragraph below describes the set up for such approach, if we were to do it without using statistical software. Fill in the blanks with a number or phrase, whichever is appropriate. We write <em>alive</em> on \rule{2cm}{0.5pt} cards representing patients who were alive at the end of the study, and <em>dead</em> on \rule{2cm}{0.5pt} cards representing patients who were not. Then, we shuffle these cards and split them into two groups: one group of size \rule{2cm}{0.5pt} representing treatment, and another group of size \rule{2cm}{0.5pt} representing control. We calculate the difference between the proportion of <em>dead</em> cards in the treatment and control groups (treatment - control) and record this value. We repeat this 100 times to build a distribution centered at \rule{2cm}{0.5pt}. Lastly, we calculate the fraction of simulations where the simulated differences in proportions are \rule{2cm}{0.5pt}. If this fraction is low, we conclude that it is unlikely to have observed such an outcome by chance and that the null hypothesis should be rejected in favor of the alternative.

    A raw data matrix/table may have thousands of rows.
    The data need to be summarized in order to makes sense of all the information.
    In this chapter,
    we looked at ways to summarize data <term>graphically</term>,
    <term>numerically</term>, and <term>verbally</term>.

          A single <term>categorical variable</term>
          is summarized with <term>counts</term> or <em>proportions</em>
            <idx><h>proportion</h></idx>
          in a <term>one-way table</term>.
          A <term>bar<nbsp/>chart</term> is used to show the frequency or relative frequency of the categories that the variable takes on.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Two categorical variables can be summarized in a
          <term>two-way table</term>
          and with a <term>side-by-side bar<nbsp/>chart</term>
          or a <term>segmented bar<nbsp/>chart</term>.

      <li>
        <p>
          When looking at a single <term>numerical variable</term>,
          we try to understand the <term>distribution</term> of the variable.
          The distribution of a variable can be represented with a frequency table and with a graph,
          such as a <term>stem-and-leaf plot</term>
          or <term>dot plot</term> for small data sets,
          or a <term>histogram</term> for larger data sets.
          If only a summary is desired,
          a <term>box plot</term> may be used.

      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The <term>distribution</term> of a variable can be described and summarized with <term>center</term>
          (mean or median),
          <term>spread</term> (SD or IQR), and <term>shape</term>
          (right skewed, left skewed, approximately symmetric).
        </p>

      <li>
        <p>
          <em>Z-scores</em>
            <idx><h>Z-score</h></idx>
          and <em>percentiles</em>
            <idx><h>percentile</h></idx>
          are useful for identifying a data point's relative position within a data set.
        </p>

      <li>
        <p>
          <em>Outliers</em>
            <idx><h>outlier</h></idx>
          are values that appear extreme relative to the rest of the data.
          Investigating outliers can provide insight into properties of the data or may reveal data collection/entry errors.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          When <em>comparing the distribution</em>
            <idx><h>comparing distributions</h></idx>
          of two variables, use two dot plots, two histograms,
          a back-to-back stem-and-leaf, or parallel box plots.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          To look at the <term>association</term>
          between two numerical variables,
          use a <term>scatterplot</term>.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    Graphs and numbers can summarize data,
    but they alone are insufficient.
    It is the role of the researcher or data scientist to ask questions,
    to use these tools to identify patterns and departure from patterns,
    and to make sense of this in the context of the data.
    Strong writing skills are critical for being able to communicate the results to a wider audience.
