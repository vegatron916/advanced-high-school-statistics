    We hope readers will take away three ideas from this book in addition to forming a foundation of statistical thinking and methods.
    <ol>

        <title>(1)</title>
        <p>
          Statistics is an applied field with a wide range of practical applications.

          You don't have to be a math guru to learn from real, interesting data.

          Data are messy, and statistical tools are imperfect.
          But, when you understand the strengths and weaknesses of these tools,
          you can use them to learn about the real<nbsp/>world.

  <p>
    We also have improved the ability to access data in this book through the addition of <xref ref="appendix_data">Appendix</xref>,
    which provides additional information for each of the data sets used in the main text and is new in the Second Edition.
    Online guides to each of these data sets are also provided at
    <url href="\oiRedirectUrl{data}"><em>openintro.org/data</em></url>
    and through a
    <url href="\oiRedirectUrl{textbook-github_openintro}">companion R<nbsp/>package</url>.

    \subsection*{{Examples and exercises}}
  </p>
  <p>
    Many examples are provided to establish an understanding of how to apply methods.
  </p>
  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        This is an example.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        Full solutions to examples are provided here, within the example.
      </p>
    </solution>
  </example>
  <p>
    When we think the reader should be ready to do an example problem on their own,
    we frame it as Guided Practice.
  </p>
  <exercise>
    <statement>
      <p>
        The reader may check or learn the answer to any Guided Practice problem by reviewing the full solution in a footnote.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <answer>
      <p>
        Guided Practice solutions are always located down here!
      </p>
    </answer>
  </exercise>
  <p>
    Exercises are also provided at the end of each section and each chapter for practice or homework assignments.
    Solutions for odd-numbered exercises are given in <xref ref="eoceSolutions">Appendix</xref>.
