        Does being part of a support group affect the ability of people to quit smoking?
        A county health department enrolled 300 smokers in a randomized experiment. 150 participants were assigned to a group that used a nicotine patch and met weekly with a support group;
        the other 150 received the patch and did not meet with a support group.
        At the end of the study, 40 of the participants in the patch plus support group had quit smoking while only 30 smokers had quit in the other group.

              Answer each of the following questions under the null hypothesis that being part of a support group does not affect the ability of people to quit smoking,
              and indicate whether the expected values are higher or lower than the observed values.

        Complete the following computations under the null hypothesis of independence between an individual's party affiliation and his support of full-body scans.
        It may be useful to first add on an extra column for row totals before proceeding with the computations.

        Lymphatic filariasis is a disease caused by a parasitic worm.

        which people are working to eliminate entirely.

    <em>Calculating</em> a confidence interval or a test statistic and p-value are generally done with statistical software.
    It is important,
    then, to focus not on the calculations, but rather on

          choosing the correct procedure

  <p>
    Choosing the correct procedure requires understanding the <em>type of data</em>
    and the <em>method of data collection</em>.
    All of the inference procedures in Chapter<nbsp/>\thechapter<nbsp/>are for categorical variables.
    Here we list the five tests encountered in this chapter and when to use them.

          <li>
            <p>
              Determine if, in a single population,
              there is an association between two categorical variables;
              e.g. grade level and favorite class.

    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Even when the data and data collection method correspond to a particular test,
    we must <em>verify that conditions are met</em>
    to see if the assumptions of the test are reasonable.
    All of the inferential procedures of this chapter require some type of random sample or process.
    In addition,
    the 1-proportion Z-test/interval and the 2-proportion Z-test/interval require that the success-failure condition is met and the three <m>\chi^2</m> tests require that all expected counts are at least 5.
  </p>
  <p>
    Finally, understanding and communicating the logic of a test and being able to accurately <em>interpret</em>
    a confidence interval or p-value are essential.
    For a refresher on this, review Chapter 5: Foundations for inference.
