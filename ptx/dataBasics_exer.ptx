    <title>Air pollution and birth outcomes, study components</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Researchers collected data to examine the relationship between air pollutants and preterm births in Southern California.
        During the study air pollution levels were measured by air quality monitoring stations.
        Specifically,
        levels of carbon monoxide were recorded in parts per million,
        nitrogen dioxide and ozone in parts per hundred million,
        and coarse particulate matter (PM<m>_{10}</m>) in <m>\mu g/m^3</m>.
        Length of gestation data were collected on 143,196 births between the years 1989 and 1993,
        and air pollution exposure during gestation was calculated for each birth.
        The analysis suggested that increased ambient PM<m>_{10}</m> and,
        to a lesser degree, CO concentrations may be associated with the occurrence of preterm births.\footfullcite{Ritz+Yu+Chapa+Fruin:2000}

    <title>Buteyko method, study components</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        The Buteyko method is a shallow breathing technique developed by Konstantin Buteyko,
        a Russian doctor, in 1952.
        Anecdotal evidence suggests that the Buteyko method can reduce asthma symptoms and improve quality of life.
        In a scientific study to determine the effectiveness of this method,
        researchers recruited 600 asthma patients aged 18-69 who relied on medication for asthma treatment.
        These patients were randomnly split into two research groups:
        one practiced the Buteyko method and the other did not.
        Patients were scored on quality of life, activity,
        asthma symptoms, and medication reduction on a scale from 0 to 10.
        On average, the participants in the Buteyko group experienced a significant reduction in asthma symptoms and an improvement in quality of life.\footfullcite{McDowan:2003}

      <p>
        Researchers studying the relationship between honesty,
        age and self-control conducted an experiment on 160 children between the ages of 5 and 15.
        Participants reported their age, sex,
        and whether they were an only child or not.
        The researchers asked each child to toss a fair coin in private and to record the outcome
        (white or black)
        on a paper sheet,
        and said they would only reward children who report white.\footfullcite{Bucciol:2011}

              The study's findings can be summarized as follows: "Half the students were explicitly told not to cheat and the others were not given any explicit instructions.
              In the no instruction group probability of cheating was found to be uniform across groups based on child's characteristics.
              In the group that was explicitly told to not cheat,
              girls were less likely to cheat,
              and while rate of cheating didn't vary by age for boys,
              it decreased with age for girls." How many variables were recorded for each subject in the study in order to conclude these findings?

      <p>
        In a study of the relationship between socio-economic class and unethical behavior, 129 University of California undergraduates at Berkeley were asked to identify themselves as having low or high social-class by comparing themselves to others with the most (least) money,
        most (least) education, and most (least) respected jobs.
        They were also presented with a jar of individually wrapped candies and informed that the candies were for children in a nearby laboratory,
        but that they could take some if they wanted.
        After completing some unrelated tasks,
        participants reported the number of candies they had taken.\footfullcite{Piff:2012}

        introduced a study exploring whether acupuncture had any effect on migraines.
        Researchers conducted a randomized controlled study where patients were randomly assigned to one of two groups:
        treatment or control.
        The patients in the treatment group received acupuncture that was specifically designed to treat migraines.
        The patients in the control group received placebo acupuncture
        (needle insertion at non-acupoint locations). 24 hours after patients received acupuncture,
        they were asked if they were pain free.
