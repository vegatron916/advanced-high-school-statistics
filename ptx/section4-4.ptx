        Suppose 80% of people like peanut butter, 89% like jelly,

        The following table displays the distribution of health status of respondents to this survey (excellent,
        very good,
        good, fair,
        poor) and whether or not they have health insurance.

        Assortative mating is a nonrandom mating pattern where individuals with similar genotypes and/or phenotypes mate with one another more frequently than what would be expected under a random mating pattern.
        Researchers studying this topic collected data on eye colors of 204 Scandinavian men and their female partners.

      <p>
        A genetic test is used to determine if people have a predisposition for <em>thrombosis</em>,
        which is the formation of a blood clot inside a blood vessel that obstructs the flow of blood through the circulatory system.
        It is believed that 3% of people actually have this predisposition.
        The genetic test is 99% accurate if a person actually has the predisposition,
        meaning that the probability of a positive test result when a person actually has the predisposition is 0.99.
        The test is 98% accurate if a person does not have the predisposition.
        What is the probability that a randomly selected person who tests positive for the predisposition by the test actually has the predisposition?

        MISSINGVIDEOLINK ahss_eoce_sol-tree_lupus<nbsp/> Lupus is a medical phenomenon where antibodies that are supposed to attack foreign cells to prevent infections instead see plasma proteins as foreign bodies,
        leading to a high risk of blood clotting.
        It is believed tha t 2% of the population suffer from this disease.
        The test is 98% accurate if a person actually has the disease.
        The test is 74% accurate if a person does not have the disease.
        There is a line from the Fox television show <em>House</em>
        that is often used after a patient tests positive for lupus: ``It's never lupus." Do you think there is truth to this statement?
