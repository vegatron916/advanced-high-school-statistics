    <title>Migraine and acupuncture,
    Part 1</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        A migraine is a particularly painful type of headache,
        which patients sometimes wish to treat with acupuncture.
        To determine whether acupuncture relieves migraine pain,
        researchers conducted a randomized controlled study where 89 females diagnosed with migraine headaches were randomly assigned to one of two groups:
        treatment or control. 43 patients in the treatment group received acupuncture that is specifically designed to treat migraines. 46 patients in the control group received placebo acupuncture
        (needle insertion at non-acupoint locations). 24 hours after patients received acupuncture,
        they were asked if they were pain free.
        Results are summarized in the contingency table below.\footfullcite{Allais:2011}

            Your findings so far might suggest that acupuncture is an effective treatment for migraines for all people who suffer from migraines.
            However this is not the only possible conclusion that can be drawn based on your findings so far.
            What is one other possible explanation for the observed difference between the percentages of patients that are pain free 24 hours after receiving acupuncture in the two groups?

    <title>Sinusitis and antibiotics,
    Part 1</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Researchers studying the effect of antibiotic treatment for acute sinusitis compared to symptomatic treatments randomly assigned 166 adults diagnosed with acute sinusitis to one of two groups:
        treatment or control.
        Study participants received either a 10-day course of amoxicillin
        (an antibiotic)
        or a placebo similar in appearance and taste.
        The placebo consisted of symptomatic treatments such as acetaminophen,
        nasal decongestants, etc.
        At the end of the 10-day period,
        patients were asked if they experienced improvement in symptoms.
        The distribution of responses is summarized below. \footfullcite{Garbutt:2012}

            Your findings so far might suggest a real difference in effectiveness of antibiotic and placebo treatments for improving symptoms of sinusitis.
            However, this is not the only possible conclusion that can be drawn based on your findings so far.
            What is one other possible explanation for the observed difference between the percentages of patients in the antibiotic and placebo treatment groups that experience improvement in symptoms of sinusitis?
