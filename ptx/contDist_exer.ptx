        The relative frequency table below displays the distribution of annual total personal income (in 2009 inflation-adjusted dollars) for a representative sample of 96,420,486 Americans.
        These data come from the American Community Survey for 2005-2009.

    This chapter focused on understanding likelihood and chance variation,
    first by solving individual probability questions and then by investigating probability distributions.
  </p>
  <p>
    The main probability techniques covered in this chapter are as follows:
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          The <term>General Multiplication Rule</term> for <em>and</em>
          probabilities (intersection),
          along with the special case when events are <term>independent</term>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The <term>General Addition Rule</term>
          for <em>or</em> probabilities (union),
          along with the special case when events are
          <term>mutually exclusive</term>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The <term>Conditional Probability Rule</term>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Tree diagrams and <term>Bayes' Theorem</term>
          to solve more complex conditional problems.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The <em>Binomial Formula</em>
            <idx><h>binomial formula</h></idx>
          for finding the probability of exactly <m>x</m> successes in <m>n</m> independent trials.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <em>Simulations</em>
            <idx><h>simulation</h></idx>
          and the use of random digits to estimate probabilities.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    Fundamental to all of these problems is understanding when events are independent and when they are mutually exclusive.
    Two events are <term>independent</term>
    when the outcome of one does not affect the outcome of the other, i.e.
    <m>P(A | B) = P(A)</m>.
    Two events are <term>mutually exclusive</term>
    when they cannot both happen together, i.e.
    <m>P(A \text{ and } B) = 0</m>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Moving from solving individual probability questions to studying probability distributions helps us better understand chance processes and quantify expected chance variation.
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          For a <term>discrete probability distribution</term>,
          the <term>sum</term> of the probabilities must equal 1.
          For a <term>continuous probability distribution</term>,
          the <term>area under the curve</term>
          represents a probability and the total area under the curve must equal<nbsp/>1.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          As with any distribution,
          one can calculate the mean and standard deviation of a probability distribution.
          In the context of a probability distribution,
          the <term>mean</term> and <term>standard deviation</term>
          describe the average and the typical deviation from the average,
          respectively,
          after many, many repetitions of the chance process.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          A probability distribution can be summarized by its
          <term>center</term> (mean, median),
          <term>spread</term> (SD, IQR), and <term>shape</term>
          (right skewed, left skewed, approximately symmetric).
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Adding a constant to every value in a probability distribution adds that value to the mean,
          but it does not affect the standard deviation.
          When multiplying every value by a constant,
          this multiplies the mean by the constant and it multiplies the standard deviation by the absolute value of the constant.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The mean of the sum of two random variables equals the sum of the means.
          However, this is not true for standard deviations.
          Instead, when finding the standard deviation of a sum or difference of random variables,
          take the square root of the sum of each of the standard deviations squared.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    The study of probability is useful for measuring uncertainty and assessing risk.
    In addition,
    probability serves as the foundation for inference,
    providing a framework for evaluating when an outcome falls outside of the range of what would be expected by chance alone.
