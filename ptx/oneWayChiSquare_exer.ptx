        Determine if the statements below are true or false.
        For each false statement,
        suggest an alternative wording to make it a true statement.

              The chi-square distribution,
              just like the normal distribution,
              has two parameters, mean and standard deviation.

          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              The chi-square distribution is always right skewed,
              regardless of the value of the degrees of freedom parameter.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              The chi-square statistic is always positive.

          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              As the degrees of freedom increases,
              the shape of the chi-square distribution becomes more skewed.

        MISSINGVIDEOLINK ahss_eoce_sol-opensource_text_chisq_GOF<nbsp/> A professor using an open source introductory statistics book predicts that 60% of the students will purchase a hard copy of the book, 25% will print it out from the web,
        and 15% will read it online.
        At the end of the semester he asks his students to complete a survey where they indicate what format of the book they used.
        Of the 126 students, 71 said they bought a hard copy of the book, 30 said they printed it out from the web,
        and 25 said they read it online.
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              State the hypotheses for testing if the professor's predictions were inaccurate.

    <statement>
      <p>
        Microhabitat factors associated with forage and bed sites of barking deer in Hainan Island, China were examined.
        In this region woods make up 4.8% of the land,
        cultivated grass plot makes up 14.7%, and deciduous forests make up 39.6%. Of the 426 sites where the deer forage, 4 were categorized as woods, 16 as cultivated grassplot,
        and 61 as deciduous forests.
        The table below summarizes these data.\footfullcite{Teng:2004}
