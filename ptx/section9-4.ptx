    <statement>
      <p>
        Suppose we fit a regression line to predict the shelf life of an apple based on its weight.
        For a particular apple, we predict the shelf life to be 4.6 days.
        The apple's residual is -0.6 days.
        Did we over or under estimate the shelf-life of the apple?
