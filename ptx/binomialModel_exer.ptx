        A dreidel is a four-sided spinning top with the Hebrew letters <em>nun</em>,

        and <em>shin</em>, one on each side.
        Each side is equally likely to come up in a single spin of the dreidel.

    <title>Sickle cell anemia</title>

      <p>
        Sickle cell anemia is a genetic blood disorder where red blood cells lose their flexibility and assume an abnormal, rigid,
        <q>sickle</q>
        shape, which results in a risk of various complications.
        If both parents are carriers of the disease,
        then a child has a 25% chance of having the disease, 50% chance of being a carrier,
        and 25% chance of neither having the disease nor being a carrier.
        If two parents who are carriers of the disease have 3 children,
        what is the probability that
