        { <em>In theFriday the 13<m>^{\text{ th } }</m>, Part I </em>}early 1990's, researchers in the UK collected data on traffic flow,

        The histograms below show the distribution of number of cars passing by a specific intersection on Friday the 6<m>^{\text{ th } }</m> and Friday the 13<m>^{\text{ th } }</m> for many such date pairs.
        Also given are some sample statistics,
        where the difference is the number of cars on the 6th minus the number of cars on the 13th.\footfullcite{Scanlon:1993} <image width="73%" source="images/friday_13th_traffic_hist.png" />

    <title>Diamonds, Part I</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Prices of diamonds are determined by what is known as the 4 Cs:
        cut, clarity, color, and carat weight.
        The prices of diamonds go up as the carat weight increases,
        but the increase is not smooth.
        For example,
        the difference between the size of a 0.99 carat diamond and a 1 carat diamond is undetectable to the naked human eye,
        but the price of a 1 carat diamond tends to be much higher than the price of a 0.99 diamond.
        In this question we use two random samples of diamonds, 0.99 carats and 1 carat,
        each sample of size 23, and compare the average prices of the diamonds.
        In order to be able to compare equivalent units,
        we first divide the price for each diamond by 100 times its weight in carats.
        That is, for a 0.99 carat diamond,
        we divide the price by 99.
        For a 1 carat diamond, we divide the price by 100.
        The distributions and some sample statistics are shown below.\footfullcite{ggplot2}
      </p>
      <sidebyside>
        Conduct a hypothesis test to evaluate if there is a difference between the
        average standardized prices of 0.99 and 1 carat diamonds. Make sure to state
        your hypotheses clearly, check relevant conditions, and interpret your results
        in context of the data.

    <title>Prison isolation experiment, Part I</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Subjects from Central Prison in Raleigh, NC, volunteered for an experiment involving an
        <q>isolation</q>
        experience.
        The goal of the experiment was to find a treatment that reduces subjects' psychopathic deviant T scores.
        This score measures a person's need for control or their rebellion against control,
        and it is part of a commonly used mental health test called the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) test.
        The experiment had three treatment groups:
        <ol type="1">
          <li>
            <p>
              Four hours of sensory restriction plus a 15 minute
              <q>therapeutic</q>
              tape advising that professional help is available.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Four hours of sensory restriction plus a 15 minute
              <q>emotionally neutral</q>
              tape on training hunting dogs.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Four hours of sensory restriction but no taped message.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>
      <p>
        Forty-two subjects were randomly assigned to these treatment groups,
        and an MMPI test was administered before and after the treatment.
        Distributions of the differences between pre and post treatment scores (pre - post) are shown below,
        along with some sample statistics.
        Use this information to independently test the effectiveness of each treatment.
        Make sure to clearly state your hypotheses, check conditions,
        and interpret results in the context of the data.\footfullcite{data:prison}

    We've reviewed a wide set of inference procedures over the last 3 chapters.
    Let's revisit each and discuss the similarities and differences among them.
    The following confidence intervals and tests are structurally the same <mdash/> they all involve inference on a population parameter,
    where that parameter is a proportion,
    a difference of proportions,
    a mean, a mean of differences, or a difference of means.
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          1-proportion <m>z</m>-test/interval
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          2-proportion <m>z</m>-test/interval
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          1-sample <m>t</m>-test/interval
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          matched pairs <m>t</m>-test/interval
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          2-sample <m>t</m>-test/interval
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    The above inferential procedures all involve a
    <term>point estimate</term>,
    a <term>standard error</term> of the estimate,
    and an assumption about the <term>shape of the sampling distribution</term> of the point estimate.
  </p>
  <p>
    From <xref ref="inferenceForCategoricalData">Chapter</xref>,
    the <m>\chi^2</m> tests and their uses are as follows:
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          <m>\chi^2</m> goodness of fit - compares a categorical variable to a known/fixed distribution.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <m>\chi^2</m> test of homogeneity - compares a categorical variable across multiple groups.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <m>\chi^2</m> test of independence - looks for association between two categorical variables.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    <m>\chi^2</m> is a measure of <em>overall</em>
    deviation between observed values and expected values.
    These tests stand apart from the others because when using <m>\chi^2</m> there is not a parameter of interest.
    For this reason there are no confidence intervals using <m>\chi^2</m>.
    Also, for <m>\chi^2</m> tests,
    the hypotheses are usually written in words,
    because they are about the <em>distribution</em>
    of one or more categorical variables,
    not about a single parameter.
  </p>
  <p>
    While formulas and conditions vary,
    all of these procedures follow the same basic logic and process.
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          For a confidence interval,
          identify the parameter to be estimated and the confidence level.
          For a hypothesis test,
          identify the hypotheses to be tested and the significance level.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Choose the correct procedure.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Check that both conditions for its use are met.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Calculate the confidence interval or the test statistic and p-value,
          as well as the <m>df</m> if applicable.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Interpret the results and draw a conclusion based on the data.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
