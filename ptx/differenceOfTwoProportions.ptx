            How much more effective is a blood thinner than a placebo for those who undergo CPR for a heart attack?

    <title>Sampling distribution of the difference of two proportions</title>
    <p>
      In this section we want to compare two proportions to each other.
      We can start by taking their difference.
      If the difference is positive it tells us that the first one is larger.
      If it is negative, it tells use that the second one is larger.
      If the difference is zero, it tells us that they are equal.
      When comparing two proportions, then,
      the quantity that we want to estimate is really the difference:
      <m>p_1-p_2</m>.
      This tells us how far apart the two proportions are.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before we find a test statistic and perform inference for the two proportion case,
      we must investigate the sampling distribution of <m>\hat{p}_1-\hat{p}_2</m>,
      which will become our point estimate.
      We know that the sampling distribution should be centered on <m>p_1-p_2</m>.
      The standard deviation of <m>\hat{p}_1-\hat{p}_2</m> can be computed as:
      <md>
        <mrow>SD_{\hat{p}_1 - \hat{p}_2} = \sqrt{(SD_{\hat{p}_1})^2 + (SD_{\hat{p}_2})^2} = \sqrt{\frac{p_1(1-p_1)}{n_1} + \frac{p_2(1-p_2)}{n_2}}</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      Like with <m>\hat{p}</m>,
      the difference of two sample proportions
      <m>\hat{p}_1-\hat{p}_2</m> follows a normal distribution when certain conditions are met.
      First, the sampling distribution for each sample proportion must be nearly normal,
      and secondly,
      the samples must be independent.
      Under these two conditions,
      the sampling distribution of
      <m>\hat{p}_1 - \hat{p}_2</m> may be well approximated using the normal model.
    </p>
  </subsection>
  <subsection>
    <title>Checking conditions for inference using a normal distribution</title>
    <p>
      When comparing two proportions,
      we carry out inference on <m>p_1-p_2</m>.
      The assumptions are that the observations are independent,
      both between groups and within groups and that the sampling distribution of <m>\hat{p}_1-\hat{p}_2</m> is nearly normal.
      We check whether these assumptions are reasonable by verifying the following conditions.
    </p>
    <solution>
      <p>
        \item[Independent.] Observations between groups can be considered independent when the data are collected from two independent random samples or,
        in the context of experiments,
        from two randomly assigned treatments.
        Randomly assigning subjects to treatments is equivalent to randomly assigning treatments to subjects.
        When sampling without replacement from a finite population,
        observations can be considered independent when sampling less than 10% of the population. \item[Nearly normal sampling distribution.] The sampling distribution of
        <m>\hat{p}_1-\hat{p}_2</m> will be nearly normal when the success-failure condition is met for both groups.
        In the two sample case, Instead of checking two inequalities,
        there are four to check.

      We consider an experiment for patients who underwent CPR for a heart attack and were subsequently admitted to a hospital.
      These patients were randomly divided into a treatment group where they received a blood thinner or the control group where they did not receive a blood thinner.
      The outcome variable of interest was whether the patients survived for at least 24 hours.
      The results are shown in <xref ref="resultsForCPRStudyInSmallSampleSection">Figure</xref>.

    <p>
      Here, the parameter of interest is a difference of population proportions,
      specifically,
      the difference in the proportion of similar patients that would survive for at least 24 hours if in the treatment group versus if in the control group.
      Let:
      <md>
        <mrow>p_1:\amp  \text{ proportion that would survive in treatment group, and }</mrow>
        <mrow>p_2:\amp  \text{ proportion that would survive in control group }</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the parameter of interest is <m>p_1 - p_2</m>.
      In order to use a Z-interval to estimate this difference,
      we must see if the point estimate,
      <m>\hat{p}_{1} - \hat{p}_{2}</m>,
      follows a normal distribution.
      Because the patients were randomly assigned to one of the two groups and one heart attack patient is unlikely to influence the next that was in the study,
      the observations are considered independent,
      both within the samples and between the samples.
      Next, the success-failure condition should be verified for each group.
      We use the sample proportions along with the sample<nbsp/>sizes to check the condition.
      <md>
        <mrow>n_1\hat{p}_1\amp \ge 10 \amp  n_1(1-\hat{p}_1)\amp \ge 10 \amp  n_2\hat{p}_2\amp \ge 10 \amp  n_2(1-\hat{p}_2)\amp \ge 10</mrow>
        <mrow>40 \times \frac{14}{40} \amp \ge 10 \amp 40 \times (1-\frac{14}{40}) \amp \ge 10 \amp 50 \times \frac{11}{50} \amp \ge 10 \amp 50 \times (1-\frac{11}{50}) \amp \ge 10</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      Because all conditions are met,
      the normal model can be used for the point estimate of the difference in survival rate.
    </p>
    <p>
      The point estimate is:
      <md>
        <mrow>\hat{p}_{1} - \hat{p}_{2} = \frac{14}{40} - \frac{11}{50} = 0.35 - 0.22 = 0.13</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      We compute the standard error for the difference of sample proportions in the same way that we compute the standard deviation for the difference of sample proportions <mdash/> the only difference is that we use the sample proportions in place of the population proportions:
      <md>
        <mrow>SE \amp = \sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}_1(1-\hat{p}_1)}{n_1} + \frac{\hat{p}_2(1-\hat{p}_2)}{n_2}}= \sqrt{\frac{0.35 (1 - 0.35)}{40} + \frac{0.22 (1 - 0.22)}{50}} = 0.095</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      Let us estimate the true difference in survival rate with 90% confidence.
      For a 90% confidence level, we use <m>z^{\star} = 1.645</m>.
      The 90% confidence interval is calculated as:
      <md>
        <mrow>\text{ point estimate }  \ \pm\amp \ z^{\star} \times SE\ \text{ of estimate }</mrow>
        <mrow>0.13 \ \pm\amp \ 1.65\times 0.095</mrow>
        <mrow>(-0.027,\ \amp  0.287)</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      We are 90% confident that the true difference in the survival rate
      (treatment <m>-</m> control)
      lies between -0.027 and 0.095.
      That is, we are 90% confident that the treatment of blood thinners changes survival rate for patients like those in the study by -2.7% to +28.7% percentage points.
      Because this interval contains both negative and positive values,
      we do not have enough information to say with confidence whether blood thinners harm or help heart attack patients who have been admitted after they have undergone CPR.

      <statement>
        <p>
          A remote control car company is considering a new manufacturer for wheel gears.
          The new manufacturer would be more expensive but their higher quality gears are more reliable,
          resulting in happier customers and fewer warranty claims.
          However, management must be convinced that the more expensive gears are worth the conversion before they approve the switch.
          The quality control engineer collects a sample of gears,
          examining 1000 gears from each company and finds that 879 gears pass inspection from the current supplier and 958 pass inspection from the prospective supplier.
          Using these data,
          construct a 95% confidence interval for the difference in the proportion from each supplier that would pass inspection.
          Use the five step framework described above to organize your work.

        <p>
          \item[<em>Identify</em>:] First we identify the parameter of interest.
          Here the parameter we wish to estimate is the true difference in the proportion of gears from each supplier that would pass inspection,
          <m>p_1-p_2</m>.
          We will take the difference as:
          current <m>-</m> prospective,
          so <m>p_1</m> is the true proportion that would pass from the current supplier and <m>p_2</m> is the true proportion that would pass from the prospective supplier.
          We will estimate the difference using a 95% confidence level. \item[<em>Choose</em>:] Because the parameter to be estimated is a difference of proportions,
          we will use a 2-proportion Z-interval. \item[<em>Check</em>:] The samples are independent,
          but not necessarily random,
          so to proceed we must assume the gears are all independent.
          For this sample we will suppose this assumption is reasonable,
          but the engineer would be more knowledgeable as to whether this assumption is appropriate.
          We also must verify the minimum sample<nbsp/>size conditions:
          <md>

          </md>
        </p>
        <p>
          The success-failure condition is met for both samples. \item[<em>Calculate</em>:] We will calculate the interval:

          </md>

        <p>
          The point estimate is the difference of sample proportions:
          <m>\hat{p}_1-\hat{p}_2 = 0.879 - 0.958 = -0.079</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <m>SE</m> of the difference of sample proportions is:

          <m>\sqrt{\frac{\ \hat{p}_1(1-\hat{p}_1)\ }{n_1}+ \frac{\hat{p}_2(1-\hat{p}_2)}{n_2}\ } = \sqrt{\frac{0.879(1-0.879)}{1000} +\frac{0.958(1-0.958)}{1000}}= 0.0121</m>
        </p>
        <p>
          So the 95% confidence interval is given by:

        </p>
        <p>
          \item[<em>Conclude</em>:] We are 95% confident that the true difference

          in the proportion that would pass inspection is between -0.103 and -0.055,
          meaning that we are 95% confident that the prospective supplier would have between a 5.5% and 10.3% <em>greater</em>
          rate of passing inspection.
          Because the entire interval is below zero,
          the data provide sufficient evidence that the prospective gears pass inspection more often than the current gears.

          There is a random sample involved,
          but there are also two treatments.
          Half of the the respondents are given the original statement order and the other half,
          randomly,
          are given the reversed statement order.
          This is an experiment because there are randomly assigned treatments.

      The approval percents of 47% and 34% seem far apart.
      However, could this difference be due to random chance?
      We will answer this question using a hypothesis test.
      To simplify things, let
      <md>
        <mrow>p_1\amp  \text{ : the proportion of respondents that would approve of policy with the original statement ordering, and }</mrow>
        <mrow>p_2\amp  \text{ : the proportion of respondents that would approve of policy with the reversed statement ordering. }</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Set up hypotheses to test whether the two statement orders produce the same response.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          The null claim is that the question order does not matter, that is,
          that the two proportions should be equal.
          The alternate claim, the one that bears the burden of proof,
          is that the question ordering does matter.
        </p>
        <p>
          <m>H_0</m>: <m>p_1 = p_2</m>
        </p>
        <p>
          <m>H_A</m>: <m>p_1 \ne p_2</m>
        </p>
      </solution>
    </example>
    <p>
      Now, we can note that:
      <md>
        <mrow>p_1=p_2 \amp \text{ is equivalent to }  p_1-p_2=0\text{ , and }</mrow>
        <mrow>p_1\ne p_2 \amp \text{ is equivalent to }  p_1-p_2\ne 0</mrow>
      </md>.
    </p>
    <p>
      We can now see that the hypotheses are really about a difference of proportions:
      <m>p_1-p_2</m>.
      In the last section,
      we used a 2-proportion Z-interval to estimate the parameter <m>p_1-p_2</m>;
      here, we will use a 2-proportion Z-test to test the null hypothesis that
      <m>p_1-p_2=0</m>, i.e. that <m>p_1=p_2</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Recall that the test statistic Z has the form:
      <md>
        <mrow>Z = \frac{\text{ point estimate }  - \text{ null value } }{SE\ \text{ of estimate } }</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      The parameter of interest is <m>p_1-p_2</m>,
      so the point estimate will be the observed difference of sample proportions:
      <m>\hat{p}_{1} - \hat{p}_{2} = 0.47 - 0.34 = 0.13</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The null value depends on the null hypothesis.
      The null hypothesis is that the approval rate would be the same for both statement orderings,
      i.e. that the difference is 0, therefore, the null value is 0.
      In this section we consider only the case where <m>H_0</m>:
      <m>p_1=p_2</m>,
      so the null value for the difference will always be 0.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <m>SD</m> of a difference of sample proportions has the form:
      <md>
        <mrow>SD = \sqrt{\frac{p_1(1-p_1)}{n_1} + \frac{p_2(1-p_2)}{n_2}}</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      However, in a hypothesis test,
      the distribution of the point estimate is always examined assuming the null hypothesis is true,
      i.e. in this case, <m>p_1 = p_2</m>.
      Both the success-failure check and the standard error formula should reflect this equality in the null hypothesis.
      We will use <m>p_c</m> to represent the common proportion that support healthcare law regardless of statement order:
      <md>
        <mrow>SD \amp = \sqrt{\frac{p_c(1-p_c)}{n_1} + \frac{p_c(1-p_c)}{n_2}}</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp = \sqrt{p_c(1-p_c)}\sqrt{\frac{1}{n_1} + \frac{1}{n_2}}</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      We don't know the true proportion <m>p_c</m>,
      but we can obtain a good estimate of it,
      <m>\hat{p}_c</m>, by <em>pooling</em>
      the results of both samples.
      We find the total number of
      <q>yeses</q>
      or
      <q>successes</q>
      and divide that by the total number of cases.
      This is equivalent to taking a weighted average of
      <m>\hat{p}_1</m> and <m>\hat{p}_2</m>.
      We call <m>\hat{p}_c</m> the <term>pooled sample proportion</term>,
      and we use it to check the success-failure condition and to compute the standard error when the null hypothesis is that <m>p_1 = p_2</m>.
      Here:
      <me>
        \hat{p}_c =  \frac{771(0.47) + 732(0.34)}{771+732}= 0.407
      </me>
    </p>
    <assemblage>
      <title>Pooled sample proportion</title>
      <p>
        When the null hypothesis is <m>p_1 = p_2</m>,
        it is useful to find the pooled sample proportion:
        <md>
          <mrow>\hat{p}_c = \frac{\text{ number of ``successes'' } }{\text{ number of cases } } = \frac{\text{x} _1+\text{x} _2}{n_1+n_2}=\frac{n_1\hat{p}_1 + n_2\hat{p}_2}{n_1 + n_2}</mrow>
        </md>
      </p>
      <p>
        Here <m>\text{x} _1</m> represents the number of successes in sample 1.
        If <m>\text{x} _1</m> is not given,
        it can be computed as <m>n_1\times \hat{p}_1</m>.
        Similarly, <m>\text{x} _2</m> represents the number of successes in sample<nbsp/>2 and can be computed as <m>n_2\times \hat{p}_2</m>.

        we use the pooled sample proportion (<m>\hat{p}_c</m>) to check the success-failure condition and to estimate the standard error:

          The data do come from two randomly assigned treatments,

          We can find the area in one tail and double it.
          Here, the p-value <m>\approx</m> 0.
          Because the p-value is smaller than <m>\alpha = 0.01</m>,
          we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the order of the statements affects how likely a respondent is to support the 2010 healthcare law.

            We will test the following hypotheses at the <m>\alpha=0.10</m> significance level.

          <p>
            <m>H_0</m>: <m>p_1=p_2</m> Fish oil and placebo are equally effective.

          <p>
            \item[<em>Choose</em>:] Because we are testing whether two proportions equal each other,
            we choose the \mbox{2-proportion Z-test.} \item[<em>Check</em>:] We must verify that the difference of sample proportions can be modeled using a normal distribution.
            First we note that there are two randomly assigned treatments.
            Second, we calculate the pooled proportion as follows:
            <me>
              \hat{p}_c = \frac{\text{x} _1+\text{x} _2}{n_1+n_2}=\frac{145 + 200}{12933 + 12938}=0.0133
            </me>
          </p>
          <p>
            We can now verify: <m>12933(0.0133)\geq10</m>,
            <m>12933(1-0.0133)\geq10</m>,
            <m>12938(0.0133)\geq10</m>, and <m>12938(1-0.0133)\geq10</m>,
            so both conditions are met. \item[
            <em>Calculate</em>: ] We will calculate the Z-statistic and the p-value.
            <md>
              <mrow>Z = \frac{\text{ point estimate }  - \text{ null value } }{SE \text{ of estimate } }</mrow>
            </md>
          </p>
          <p>
            The point estimate is the difference of sample proportions:
            <m>\hat{p}_1-\hat{p}_2 = 0.0112 - 0.0155 = -0.0043</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            The value hypothesized for the parameter in <m>H_0</m> is the null value:
            null value = 0.
          </p>
          <p>
            The pooled proportion, calculated above, is:
            <m>\hat{p}_c = 0.0133</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            The <m>SE</m> of the difference of sample proportions,
            assuming <m>H_0</m> is true, is:
          </p>
          <p>
            <m>\sqrt{\hat{p}_c(1-\hat{p}_c)}\sqrt{\frac{1}{n_1} + \frac{1}{n_2}} = \sqrt{0.0133(1-0.0133)}\sqrt{\frac{1}{12933} + \frac{1}{12938}}=0.00142</m>.
            <md>
              <mrow>Z = \frac{-0.0043 - 0}{0.00142} = -3.0</mrow>
            </md>
          </p>
          <p>
            Because <m>H_A</m> uses a less than,
            meaning that it is a lower-tail test,
            the \mbox{p-value} is the area to the <em>left</em>
            of <m>Z=-3.0</m> under the standard normal curve.
            This area can be found using a normal table or a calculator.
            The area or p-value = <m>0.0013</m>. \item[<em>Conclude</em>:] The p-value of 0.0013 is
            <m>\lt 0.10</m>, so we reject <m>H_0</m>;
            there is sufficient evidence that fish oil is effective in reducing heart attacks.

    <title>Section summary</title>
    <p>
      In the previous section, we looked at inference for a single proportion.
      In this section, we <em>compared</em>
      two groups to each other with respect to a proportion or a percent.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          We are interested in whether the true proportion of yeses is the same or different between two distinct groups.
          Call these proportions <m>p_1</m> and <m>p_2</m>.
          The difference,
          <m>p_1-p_2</m> tells us whether <m>p_1</m> is greater than,
          less than, or equal to <m>p_2</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          When <em>comparing</em> two proportions to each other,
          the parameter of interest is the
          <em>difference of proportions</em>,
          <m>p_1-p_2</m>, and we use the difference of sample proportions,
          <m>\hat{p}_1-\hat{p}_2</m>, as the
          <em>point estimate</em>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The sampling distribution of
          <m>\hat{p}_1-\hat{p}_2</m> is nearly normal when the success-failure condition is met for <em>both</em>
          groups and when the data is collected using 2 independent random samples or 2 randomly assigned treatments.
          When the sampling distribution of <m>\hat{p}_1-\hat{p}_2</m> is nearly normal,
          the standardized test statistic also follows a
          <term>normal</term> distribution.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          When the null hypothesis is that the two populations proportions are
          <em>equal</em> to each other,
          use the <term>pooled sample proportion</term>
          <m>\hat{p}_c=\frac{\text{x} _1+\text{x} _2}{n_1+n_2}</m>,
          i.e. the combined number of yeses over the combined sample<nbsp/>sizes,
          when verifying the success-failure condition and when finding the <m>SE</m>.
          For the confidence interval, do not use the pooled sample proportion;
          use the separate values of
          <m>\hat{p}_1</m> and <m>\hat{p}_2</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          When there are two samples or treatments and the parameter of interest is a difference of proportions,
          e.g. the true difference in proportion of 17 and 18 year olds with a summer job (proportion of 18 year olds <m>-</m> proportion of 17 year olds):
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              Estimate <m>p_1-p_2</m> at the C% confidence level using a
              <term>2-proportion Z-interval</term>.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Test <m>H_0</m>: <m>p_1-p_2=0</m> (i.e.
              <m>p_1=p_2</m>) at the <m>\alpha</m> significance level using a
              <term>2-proportion Z-test</term>.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Verify the conditions for using a normal model:
          <ul>
            <li>
              <title>1.</title>
              <p>
                Data come from 2 independent random samples or 2 randomly assigned treatments.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <title>2.</title>
              <p>
                CI: <m>n_1\hat{p}_1\ge 10</m>,
                <m>n_1(1-\hat{p}_1)\ge 10</m>,
                <m>n_2\hat{p}_2\ge 10</m>, and <m>n_2(1-\hat{p}_2)\ge 10</m>
              </p>
            </li>
            <li class="custom-list-style-type" label="">
              <p>
                Test: <m>n_1\hat{p}_c\ge 10</m>,
                <m>n_1(1-\hat{p}_c)\ge 10</m>,
                <m>n_2\hat{p}_c\ge 10</m>, and <m>n_2(1-\hat{p}_c)\ge 10</m>
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          When the conditions are met,
          we calculate the confidence interval and the test statistic using the same structure as in the previous section.
          <ul>
            <li class="custom-list-style-type" label="">
              <p>
                Confidence interval:<nbsp/> <m>\text{ point estimate } \ \pm\ z^{\star} \times SE\ \text{ of estimate }</m>
              </p>
            </li>
            <li class="custom-list-style-type" label="">
              <p>
                Test statistic:
                <m>Z = \frac{\text{ point estimate } - \text{ null value } }{SE \text{ of estimate } }</m>
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        Here the point estimate is the difference of sample proportions <m>\hat{p}_1 - \hat{p}_2</m>.
      </li>
      <li class="custom-list-style-type" label="">
        <p>
          The <m>SE</m> of estimate is the <m>SE</m> of a difference of sample proportions.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li class="custom-list-style-type" label="">
        <p>
          For a CI, use:
          <m>SE = \sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}_1(1-\hat{p}_1)}{n_1} + \frac{\hat{p}_2(1-\hat{p}_2)}{n_2}}</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li class="custom-list-style-type" label="">
        <p>
          For a Test, use:
          <m>SE = \sqrt{\hat{p}_c(1-\hat{p}_c)}\sqrt{\frac{1}{n_1} + \frac{1}{n_2}}</m>.
        </p>
