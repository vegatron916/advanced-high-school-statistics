  <title>Continuous distributions</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      So far we have looked only at cases where the random variable takes on integer values.
      What happens when we consider random variables that produce a continuous numerical variable,
      such as wait time for a bus?
      In this section,
      we introduce the concept of a continuous distribution.
      In the next chapter,
      you will encounter the most famous continuous distribution of all.<fn>
      It's the normal distribution!

          <xref ref="fdicHistograms">Figure</xref>
          shows a few different hollow histograms of the variable <c>height</c> for 3 million US adults from the mid-90's.
          How does changing the number of bins allow you to make different interpretations of the data?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <answer>
        <p>
          Adding more bins provides greater detail.
          This sample is extremely large,
          which is why much smaller bins still work well.
          Usually we do not use so many bins with smaller sample sizes since small counts per bin mean the bin heights are very volatile.
        </p>
      </answer>
    </example>
    <figure xml:id="fdicHistograms">
      <caption>Four hollow histograms of US adults heights with varying bin widths.</caption>
      <image width="73%" source="images/fdicHistograms.png" />
    </figure>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          What proportion of the sample is between 180 cm and 185 cm tall (about 5'11" to 6'1")?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution xml:id="contDistProb">
        <p>
          We can add up the heights of the bins in the range 180 cm and 185 and divide by the sample size.
          For instance,
          this can be done with the two shaded bins shown in <xref ref="usHeightsHist180185">Figure</xref>.
          The two bins in this region have counts of 195,307 and 156,239 people,
          resulting in the following estimate of the probability:
          <md>
            <mrow>\frac{195307+156239}{\text{ 3,000,000 } } = 0.1172</mrow>
          </md>
        </p>
        <p>
          This fraction is the same as the proportion of the histogram's area that falls in the range 180 to 185<nbsp/>cm.
        </p>
      </solution>
    </example>
    <figure xml:id="usHeightsHist180185">
      <caption>A histogram with bin sizes of 2.5 cm. The shaded region represents individuals with heights between 180 and 185 cm.</caption>
      <image width="95%" source="images/usHeightsHist180185.png" />
    </figure>
    <p>
      Examine the transition from a boxy hollow histogram in the top-left of <xref ref="fdicHistograms">Figure</xref>
      to the much smoother plot in the lower-right.
      In this last plot,
      the bins are so slim that the hollow histogram is starting to resemble a smooth curve.
      This suggests the population height as a <em>continuous</em>
      numerical variable might best be explained by a curve that represents the outline of extremely slim bins.
    </p>
    <p>
      This smooth curve represents a <term>probability density function</term>
      (also called a <term>density</term>
      or <term>distribution</term>),
      and such a curve is shown in <xref ref="fdicHeightContDist">Figure</xref>
      overlaid on a histogram of the sample.
      A density has a special property:
      the total area under the density's curve is 1.

    <title>Probabilities from continuous distributions</title>
    <p>
      We computed the proportion of individuals with heights 180 to 185 cm in <xref ref="contDistProb">Example</xref> as a fraction:
      <md>
        <mrow>\frac{\text{ number of people between 180 and 185 } }{\text{ total sample size } }</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      We found the number of people with heights between 180 and 185 cm by determining the fraction of the histogram's area in this region.
      Similarly, we can use the area in the shaded region under the curve to find a probability (with the help of a computer):
      <md>
        <mrow>P(\text{\texttt{height} between 180 and 185} ) = \text{ area between 180 and 185 } = 0.1157</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      The probability that a randomly selected person is between 180 and 185 cm is 0.1157.
      This is very close to the estimate from <xref ref="contDistProb">Example</xref>: 0.1172.

          What is the probability that a randomly selected person is

          Assume you can measure perfectly.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <answer>
        <p>
          This probability is zero.
          A person might be close to 180 cm,
          but not exactly 180 cm tall.
          This also makes sense with the definition of probability as area;
          there is no area captured between 180<nbsp/>cm and 180<nbsp/>cm.

          Histograms use bins with a specific width to display the distribution of a variable.
          When there is enough data and the data does not have gaps,
          as the bin width gets smaller and smaller,
          the histogram begins to resemble a smooth curve,
          or a <term>continuous distribution</term>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Continuous distributions are often used to approximate relative frequencies and probabilities.
          In a continuous distribution,
          the <em>area under the curve</em>
          corresponds to relative frequency or probability.
          The total area under a continuous probability distribution must equal 1.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Because the area under the curve for a single point is zero,
          the probability of any specific value is zero.
          This implies that, for example,
          <m>P(X \lt 5) = P(X \le 5)</m> for a continuous probability distribution.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Finding areas under curves is challenging;
          it is common to use distribution tables,
          calculators, or other technology to find such areas.
