        The scatterplots shown below each have a superimposed regression line.
        If we were to construct a residual plot
        (residuals versus <m>x</m>)
        for each, describe what those plots would look like.

        The Great Britain Office of Population Census and Surveys once collected data on a random sample of 170 married women in Britain,
        recording the age
        (in years)
        and heights
        (converted here to inches)
        of the women and their spouses.\footfullcite{Hand:1994} The scatterplot on the left shows the spouse's age plotted against the woman's age,
        and the plot on the right shows spouse's height plotted against the woman's height.

              Data on heights were originally collected in centimeters,

        A study conducted at the University of Denver investigated whether babies take longer to learn to crawl in cold months,
        when they are often bundled in clothes that restrict their movement,
        than in warmer months. \footfullcite{Benson:1993} Infants born during the study year were split into twelve groups,
        one for each birth month.
        We consider the average crawling age of babies in each group against the average temperature when the babies are six months old
        (that's when babies often begin trying to crawl).
        Temperature is measured in degrees Fahrenheit (^\circ F) and age is measured in weeks.
