    <title>Social experiment, Part I</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        A ``social experiment" conducted by a TV program questioned what people do when they see a very obviously bruised woman getting picked on by her boyfriend.
        On two different occasions at the same restaurant,
        the same couple was depicted.
        In one scenario the woman was dressed
        <q>provocatively</q>
        and in the other scenario the woman was dressed
        <q>conservatively</q>. The table below shows how many restaurant diners were present under each scenario,
        and whether or not they intervened.

    <title>Heart transplant success</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        The Stanford University Heart Transplant Study was conducted to determine whether an experimental heart transplant program increased lifespan.
        Each patient entering the program was officially designated a heart transplant candidate,
        meaning that he was gravely ill and might benefit from a new heart.
        Patients were randomly assigned into treatment and control groups.
        Patients in the treatment group received a transplant,
        and those in the control group did not.
        The table below displays how many patients survived and died in each group. \footfullcite{Turnbull+Brown+Hu:1974}

        Suppose we are interested in estimating the difference in survival rate between the control and treatment groups using a confidence interval.
        Explain why we cannot construct such an interval using the normal approximation.
        What might go wrong if we constructed the confidence interval despite this problem?

    <title>Gender and color preference</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        A study asked 1,924 male and 3,666 female undergraduate college students their favorite color.
        A 95% confidence interval for the difference between the proportions of males and females whose favorite color is black
        <m>(p_{male} - p_{female})</m> was calculated to be (0.02, 0.06).
        Based on this information,
        determine if the following statements are true or false,
        and explain your reasoning for each statement you identify as false. \footfullcite{Ellis:2001}

        Researchers studying the link between prenatal vitamin use and autism surveyed the mothers of a random sample of children aged 24 - 60 months with autism and conducted another separate random sample for children with typical development.
        The table below shows the number of mothers in each group who did and did not use prenatal vitamins during the three months before pregnancy (periconceptional period).\footfullcite{Schmidt:2011}

      <p>
        In July 2008 the US National Institutes of Health announced that it was stopping a clinical study early because of unexpected results.
        The study population consisted of HIV-infected women in sub-Saharan Africa who had been given single dose Nevaripine (a treatment for HIV) while giving birth,
        to prevent transmission of HIV to the infant.
        The study was a randomized comparison of continued treatment of a woman
        (after successful childbirth)
        with Nevaripine vs Lopinavir,
        a second drug used to treat HIV. 240 women participated in the study; 120 were randomized to each of the two treatments.
        Twenty-four weeks after starting the study treatment,
        each woman was tested to determine if the HIV infection was becoming worse
        (an outcome called <em>virologic failure</em>).
        Twenty-six of the 120 women treated with Nevaripine experienced virologic failure,
        while 10 of the 120 women treated with the other drug experienced virologic failure.\footfullcite{Lockman:2007}

    <statement>
      <p>
        A physical education teacher at a high school wanting to increase awareness on issues of nutrition and health asked her students at the beginning of the semester whether they believed the expression
        <q>an apple a day keeps the doctor away</q>, and 40% of the students responded yes.
        Throughout the semester she started each class with a brief discussion of a study highlighting positive effects of eating more fruits and vegetables.
        She conducted the same apple-a-day survey at the end of the semester,
        and this time 60% of the students responded yes.
        Can she used a two-proportion method from this section for this analysis?
        Explain your reasoning.
