    <title>Light and exam performance</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        A study is designed to test the effect of light level on exam performance of students.
        The researcher believes that light levels might have different effects on males and females,
        so wants to make sure both are equally represented in each treatment.
        The treatments are fluorescent overhead lighting,
        yellow overhead lighting, no overhead lighting
        (only desk lamps).

    <statement>
      <p>
        To assess the effectiveness of taking large doses of vitamin C in reducing the duration of the common cold,
        researchers recruited 400 healthy volunteers from staff and students at a university.
        A<nbsp/>quarter of the patients were assigned a placebo,
        and the rest were evenly divided between 1g Vitamin C, 3g Vitamin C, or 3g Vitamin C plus additives to be taken at onset of a cold for the following two days.
        All tablets had identical appearance and packaging.
        The nurses who handed the prescribed pills to the patients knew which patient received which treatment,
        but the researchers assessing the patients when they were sick did not.
        No significant differences were observed in any measure of cold duration or severity between the four medication groups,
        and the placebo group had the shortest duration of symptoms.\footfullcite{Audera:2001}

              Participants are ultimately able to choose whether or not to use the pills prescribed to them.
              We might expect that not all of them will adhere and take their pills.
              Does this introduce a confounding variable to the study?

    <title>Exercise and mental health</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        A researcher is interested in the effects of exercise on mental health and he proposes the following study: Use stratified random sampling to ensure representative proportions of 18-30, 31-40 and 41- 55 year olds from the population.
        Next, randomly assign half the subjects from each age group to exercise twice a week,
        and instruct the rest not to exercise.
        Conduct a mental health exam at the beginning and at the end of the study,
        and compare the results.

    Chapter<nbsp/>\thechapter<nbsp/> focused on various ways that researchers collect data.
    The key concepts are the difference between a sample and an experiment and the role that randomization plays in each.
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          Researchers take a <term>random sample</term>
          in order to draw an <term>inference</term>
          to the larger population from which they sampled.
          When examining observational data,
          even if the individuals were randomly sampled,
          a correlation does not imply a causal link.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          In an <term>experiment</term>,
          researchers impose a treatment and use
          <term>random assignment</term>
          in order to draw <term>causal conclusions</term>
          about the effects of the treatment.
          While often implied,
          inferences to a larger population may not be valid if the subjects were not also
          <em>randomly sampled</em> from that population.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    Related to this are some important distinctions regarding terminology.
    The terms stratifying and blocking cannot be used interchangeably.
    Likewise, taking a simple random sample is different than randomly assigning individuals to treatment groups.
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          <em><em>Stratifying</em>
            <idx><h>stratifying|textbf</h></idx>
          vs <em>Blocking</em>
            <idx><h>blocking|textbf</h></idx>
          </em>.
          Stratifying is used when sampling,
          where the purpose is to <em>sample</em>
          a subgroup from each stratum in order to arrive at a better <em>estimate</em>
          for the parameter of interest.
          Blocking is used in an experiment to
          <em>separate</em> subjects into blocks and then <em>compare</em>
          responses within those blocks.
          All subjects in a block are used in the experiment,
          not just a sample of them.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <em><em>Random sampling</em>
            <idx><h>random sampling|textbf</h></idx>
          vs <em>Random assignment</em><idx><h>random assignment|textbf</h></idx>
          </em>.
          Random sampling refers to sampling a subset of a population for the purpose of inference to that population.
          Random assignment is used in an experiment to separate subjects into groups for the purpose of comparison between those groups.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    When randomization is not employed,
    as in an <term>observational study</term>,
    neither inferences nor causal conclusions can be drawn.
    Always be mindful of possible <em>confounding factors</em><idx><h>confounding factor|textbf</h></idx> when interpreting the results of observation studies.
