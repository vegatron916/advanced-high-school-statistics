    This chapter began by introducing the normal distribution.
    A common thread that ran through this chapter is the use of the
    <term>normal approximation</term> in various contexts.
    The key steps are included for each of the normal approximation scenarios below.
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          Normal approximation for <term>data</term>: - Verify that population is approximately normal. - Use the given mean <m>\mu</m> and SD <m>\sigma</m> to find the Z-score for the given <m>x</m> value.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Normal approximation for a <em>sample mean/sum</em>
            <idx><h>sample mean</h></idx>
          :
            <idx><h>sample sum</h></idx>
          Verify that population is approximately normal or that <m>n\ge 30</m>.
          Use <m>\mu_{\bar{x}}=\mu</m> and
          <m>\sigma_{\bar{x}}=\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}</m> to find the Z-score for the given/calculated sample mean.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Normal approximation for the <term>number of successes</term>
          (binomial): - Verify that <m>np\ge 10</m> and
          <m>n(1-p)\ge 10</m>. - Use <m>\mu_{\scriptscriptstyle{X}} = np</m> and
          <m>\sigma_{\scriptscriptstyle{X}} = \sqrt{np(1-p)}</m> to find the Z-score for the given number of successes.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Normal approximation for a <term>sample proportion</term>: - Verify that <m>np\ge 10</m> and
          <m>n(1-p)\ge 10</m>. - Use <m>\mu_{\hat{p}} = p</m> and
          <m>\sigma_{\hat{p}} = \sqrt{\frac{p(1-p)}{n}}</m> to find the Z-score for the given sample proportion.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Normal approximation for the <term>sum of two independent random variables</term>: - Verify that each random variable is approximately normal. - Use <m>E(X+Y)=E(X)+E(Y)</m> and
          <m>SD(X+Y)=\sqrt{(SD(X))^2+(SD(Y))^2}</m> to find the Z-score for the given sum.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </p>
  <p>
    Cases 1 and 2 apply to <term>numerical</term> variables,
    while cases 3 and 4 are for <term>categorical</term> yes/no variables.
    Case 5 applies to both numerical and categorical variables.
  </p>
  <p>
    Note that in the binomial case and in the case of proportions,
    we never look to see if the <em>population</em> is normal.
    That would not make sense because the
    <q>population</q>
    is simply a bunch of no/yes, 0/1 values and could not possibly be normal.
  </p>
  <p>
    The <term>Central Limit Theorem</term>
    is the mathematical rule that ensures that when the sample size is sufficiently large,
    the sample mean/sum and sample proportion/count will be approximately normal.
