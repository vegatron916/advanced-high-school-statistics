    <title>Air quality</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Air quality measurements were collected in a random sample of 25 country capitals in 2013,
        and then again in the same cities in 2014.
        We would like to use these data to compare average air quality between the two years.
        Should we use a paired or non-paired test?
        Explain your reasoning.

        Let's consider a limited set of climate data,
        examining temperature differences in 1948 vs<nbsp/>2018.
        We randomly sampled 197 locations from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) historical data,
        where the data was available for both years of interest.
        We want to know:
        were there more days with temperatures exceeding 90\textdegreeF in 2018 or in<nbsp/>1948?\footfullcite{webpage:noaa_1948_2018} The difference in number of days exceeding 90\textdegreeF
        (number of days in 2018 - number of days in 1948)
        was calculated for each of the 197 locations.
        The average of these differences was 2.9 days with a standard deviation of 17.2 days.
        We are interested in determining whether these data provide strong evidence that there were more days in 2018 that exceeded 90\textdegreeF from NOAA's weather stations.

        The National Center of Education Statistics conducted a survey of high school seniors,
