  <introduction>
    <p>
      In this section,
      we will apply the inferential procedures introduced in <xref ref="ch_foundations_for_inf">Chapter</xref>
      to the context of a single proportion,
      and we will explore how to do sample<nbsp/>size calculations for data collection purposes.
      We will answer questions such as the following:
      <ul>
        <li>

        <li>
          <p>
            What percent of adults in the U.S. approve of the way the Supreme Court is handling its job?

        </li>
        <li>
          <p>

    <title>Distribution of a sample proportion (review)</title>
    <p>
      The distribution of a sample proportion,
      such as the distribution of all possible values for the proportion of people who share a particular opinion in a poll,
      was introduced in <xref ref="distributionphat">Section</xref>.
      When the sampling distribution of a sample proportion,
      <m>\hat{p}</m>, is approximately normal,
      we can use confidence intervals and hypothesis tests based on a normal distribution.
      We call these Z-intervals and Z-tests for short.
      Here, we review the conditions necessary for a sample proportion to be modeled using a normal distribution.
    </p>
    <assemblage>
      <p>
        {Conditions for the sampling distribution of <m>\hat{p}</m> being nearly normal} The sampling distribution of a sample proportion,
        <m>\hat{p}</m>,
        based on a random sample of size <m>n</m> from a population with a true proportion <m>p</m>,
        is nearly normal when
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              the sample observations are independent and
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <m>np\geq10</m> and <m>n(1-p)\geq10</m>.
              This is called the <term>success-failure condition</term>.

          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>
      <p>
        If these conditions are met,
        then the sampling distribution of <m>\hat{p}</m> is nearly normal with mean
        <m>\mu_{\hat{p}}=p</m> and standard deviation <m>\sigma_{\hat{p}} = \sqrt{\frac{\ p(1-p)\ }{n}}</m>.

    <title>Checking conditions for inference using a normal distribution</title>
    <p>
      We can use a normal model for inference for a proportion when the observations are independent and the sampling distribution of the sample proportion is nearly normal.
      We check that these assumptions are reasonable by verifying the following conditions.
    </p>
    <solution>
      <p>
        \item[Independent.] Observations can be considered independent when the data are collected from a
        <em>random process</em>,
        such as tossing a coin, or from a <em>random sample</em>.
        Without a random sample or process,
        the standard error formula would not apply,
        and it is unclear to what population the inference would apply.
        When sampling without replacement from a finite population,
        the observations can be considered independent when sampling less than 10% of the population.<fn>
        When sampling without replacement and sampling greater than 10% of the population,
        a modified standard error formula should be used.
        </fn> \item[Nearly normal sampling distribution.] We saw in <xref ref="distributionphat">Section</xref>
        that the sampling distribution of a sample proportion will be nearly normal when the success-failure condition is met,
        i.e. when the expected number of success and failures are both at least 10.
      </p>
    </solution>
    <p>
      In our examples, we generally sample from large populations,
      such as the United States.
      In these cases,
      we do not explicitly verify that the sample<nbsp/>size is less than 10% of the population size.
      However, in borderline cases,
      one should remember to check this condition as well to ensure that the standard error estimate is reasonable.

    <p>
      The Gallup organization began measuring the public's view of the Supreme Court's job performance in 2000,
      and has measured it every year since then with the question: ``Do you approve or disapprove of the way the Supreme Court is handling its job?". In 2018,
      the Gallup poll randomly sampled 1,033 adults in the U.S. and found that 53% of them approved.<fn>
      \oiRedirect{textbook-gallup_supreme_court_approval_2018}{ https://news.gallup.com/poll/237269/supreme-court-approval-highest-2009.aspx}
      </fn> We know that 53% is just a point estimate.
      What range of values are reasonable estimates for the percent of the population that approved of the job the Supreme Court is doing?
      We can use the confidence interval procedure introduced in the previous chapter to answer this question,
      but first we must clearly identify the parameter we're trying to estimate and be sure that a Z-interval will be appropriate.
      The following examples walk through the various steps for carrying out a confidence interval procedure using the Gallup poll data.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Identify the population of interest and the parameter of interest for the Gallup poll about the U.S. Supreme Court.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          Gallup sampled from U.S. adults,
          therefore the population of interest,
          and the population to which we can make an inference, is U.S. adults.
          We know the percent of the sample that said they approve of the job the Supreme Court is doing.
          However, we do not know what percent of the population would approve.
          The parameter of interest, which is unknown,
          is the percent of <em>all</em> U.S. adults that approve of the job the Supreme Court is doing.
          This is the quantity that we seek to estimate with the confidence interval.
        </p>
      </solution>
    </example>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Can the sample proportion <m>\hat{p}</m> be modeled using a normal distribution?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <answer>
        <p>
          In order to construct a Z-interval,
          the sample statistic must be able to be modeled using a normal distribution.
          Gallup took a random sample, so the first condition
          (the independence condition)
          is satisfied.
          We must also test the second condition
          (the success-failure condition)
          to ensure that the sample<nbsp/>size is large enough for the central limit theorem to apply.
          The success-failure condition is met when <m>np</m> and <m>n(1-p)</m> are at least 10.
          Since <m>p</m> is always unknown when constructing a confidence interval for <m>p</m>,
          we use the sample proportion <m>\hat{p}</m> to check this condition.
          Here we have:
          <md>
            <mrow>n\hat{p} = 1033(0.53) = 547\text{ (``successes'') }</mrow>
            <mrow>n(1-\hat{p}) = 1033(1 - 0.53) = 486\text{ (``failures'') }</mrow>
          </md>
        </p>
        <p>
          The second condition is satisfied since 547 and 486 are both at least 10.
          With the two conditions satisfied,
          we can model the sample proportion <m>\hat{p}</m> using a normal model and we can construct a Z-interval.
        </p>
      </answer>
    </example>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Calculate the point estimate and the <m>SE</m> of the estimate.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution xml:id="supremeCourtCISEExample">
        <p>
          The point estimate for the unknown parameter <m>p</m>
          (the proportion of all U.S. adults)
          who approve of the job the Supreme Court is doing) is the sample proportion.
          The point estimate here is <m>\hat{p} = 0.53</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Because the point estimate is the sample proportion,
          the <m>SE</m> of the estimate is the <m>SE</m> of <m>\hat{p}</m>.
          In <xref ref="distributionphat">Section</xref>,
          we learned that the formula for the standard deviation of <m>\hat{p}</m> is
          <md>
            <mrow>\sigma_{\hat{p}} = \sqrt{\frac{\ p(1-p)\ }{n}}</mrow>
          </md>
        </p>
        <p>
          The proportion <m>p</m> is unknown,
          so we use the sample proportion <m>\hat{p}</m> to find the <m>SE</m> of <m>\hat{p}</m>.
          <md>
            <mrow>SE = \sqrt{\frac{\ \hat{p}(1-\hat{p})\ }{n}}</mrow>

        <p>
          Here <m>\hat{p}=0.53</m> and <m>n=1,033</m>,
          so the <m>SE</m> of the sample proportion is:
          <md>
            <mrow>SE = \sqrt{\frac{\ 0.53(1-0.53)\ }{1033}}=0.016</mrow>

      <solution xml:id="x90CIForJobSupremeCourtDoingExample">
        <p>
          Recall that the general form of a confidence interval is:

          </md>
        </p>
        <p>
          We have already found the point estimate and the <m>SE</m> of the estimate.
          Because we previously verified that <m>\hat{p}</m> can be modeled using a normal distribution,
          the critical value is a <m>z^{\star}</m>.
          The <m>z^{\star}</m> value can be found in the <m>t</m>-table on <xref ref="tDistributionTable">page</xref>,
          using the bottom row (<m>\infty</m>),
          where the column corresponds to the confidence level.
          Here the confidence level is 90%, so <m>z^{\star}</m>=1.65.
          We can now construct the 90% confidence interval as follows.
          <md>
            <mrow>\text{ point estimate } \ \pm\amp \  z^{\star} \times SE\ \text{ of estimate }</mrow>
            <mrow>0.53\ \pm\amp \  1.65 \times 0.016</mrow>

          </md>
        </p>
        <p>
          We are 90% confident that the true proportion of U.S. adults who approve of the job the Supreme Court is doing is between 0.504 and .556.
        </p>
      </solution>
    </example>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Based on the interval,
          is there evidence that more than half of U.S. adults approve of the job the Supreme Court is doing?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution xml:id="JobSupremeCourtDoingEvidenceExample">
        <p>
          The 90% confidence interval (0.504,<nbsp/>0.556) provides an interval of reasonable values for the parameter.
          The value 0.50 is not in the interval,
          therefore can be considered unreasonable.
          Because the <em>entire</em> interval is above 0.50, we do have evidence,
          at the 90% confidence level, that more than half of U.S. adults
          (at the time of this poll)
          approve of the job the Supreme Court is doing.
        </p>
      </solution>
    </example>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Do we have evidence at the 95% confidence level that more than half of U.S. adults approve of the job the Supreme Court is doing?

      </statement>
      <solution xml:id="JobSupremeCourtDoingWrapUpExample">
        <p>
          First, we observe that a 95% confidence interval will be <em>wider</em>
          than a 90% confidence interval.
          For a 95% Z-interval, <m>z^{\star}=1.96</m>.
          The 95% confidence interval is:
          <md>
            <mrow>\amp 0.53\ \pm\  1.96 \times 0.016</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp = (0.499,\ 0.561)</mrow>
          </md>
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, we see that 0.50 is just barely inside the interval,
          making it within the range of reasonable values.
          Therefore, we do not have evidence,
          at the 95% confidence level, that more than half of U.S. adults
          (at the time of this poll)
          approve of the job the Supreme Court is doing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Notice that we come to a different conclusion based on different confidence levels,
          which may feel a little jarring.
          However, this will happen with real data,
          and it highlights why it is important to be explicit in identifying the confidence level being used.

          A February 2018 Marist Poll reports: ``Many Americans (68%) think there is intelligent life on other planets." The results were based on a random sample of 1,033 adults in the U.S. Does this poll provide evidence at the 95% confidence level that greater than half of all U.S. adults think there is intelligent life on other planets?
          Carry out a confidence interval procedure to answer this question.
          Use the five step framework to organize your work.

          \item[<em>Identify</em>:] First we identify the parameter of interest.
          Here the parameter is the true proportion of U.S. adults that think there is intelligent life on other planets.
          We will estimate this at the 95% confidence level. \item[<em>Choose</em>:] Because the parameter to be estimated is a single proportion,
          we will use a 1-proportion Z-interval. \item[<em>Check</em>:] We must check that a Z-interval is appropriate,
          meaning that the sample proportion can be modeled using a normal distribution.
          The problem states that the data come from a random sample.
          Also, we must check the success-failure condition.
          Here, we have that <m>1033(.68)\ge 10</m> and <m>1033(1-0.68)\ge 10</m>.
          Both conditions are met so we can proceed with a 1-proportion Z-interval. \item[<em>Calculate</em>:] We will calculate the interval:
          <md>
            <mrow>\text{ point estimate } \ \pm\ z^{\star} \times SE\ \text{ of estimate }</mrow>
          </md>
        </p>
        <p>
          The point estimate is the sample proportion:
          <m>\hat{p} = 0.68</m>
        </p>
        <p>
          The <m>SE</m> of the sample proportion is:
          <m>\sqrt{\frac{\ \hat{p}(1-\hat{p})\ }{n}} = \sqrt{\frac{0.68(1-0.68)}{1033}}=0.015</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          <m>z^{\star}</m> is found using the <m>t</m>-table at row <m>\infty</m> and confidence level C%.
        </p>
        <p>
          For a 95% confidence level, <m>z^{\star}</m> = 1.96.
        </p>
        <p>
          The 95% confidence interval is given by:
          <md>
            <mrow>0.68\ \pm\  \amp 1.96 \times \sqrt{\frac{0.68(1-0.68)}{1033}}</mrow>
            <mrow>0.68\ \pm\  \amp 1.96 \times 0.015</mrow>
            <mrow>= (0.6\amp 51,\  0.709)</mrow>
          </md>
        </p>
        <p>
          \item[<em>Conclude</em>:] We are 95% confident that the true <em>proportion</em>
          of U.S. adults that think there is intelligent life on other planets is between 0.651 and 0.709.
          Because the entire interval is above 0.5 we have evidence that greater than half of all U.S. adults think there is intelligent life on other planets.

          True or False: There is a 95% probability that between 65.1% and 70.9% of U.S. adults think that there is intelligent life on other planets.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <answer>
        <p>
          False.
          The true percent of U.S. adults that think there is intelligent life on other planets either falls in that interval or it doesn't.
          A correct interpretation of the confidence level would be that if we were to repeat this process over and over,
          about 95% of the 95% confidence intervals constructed would contain the true value.

    </p>
    <p>
      Planning a sample<nbsp/>size before collecting data is important.
      If we collect too little data,
      the standard error of our point estimate may be so large that the estimate is not very useful.
      On the other hand,
      collecting data in some contexts is time-consuming and expensive,
      so we don't want to waste resources on collecting more data than we need.
    </p>
    <p>
      When considering the sample<nbsp/>size,
      we want to put an upper bound on the margin of error.
      Recall that the <term>margin of error</term>
      is measured as the distance between the point estimate and the lower or upper bound of a confidence interval.
    </p>
    <assemblage>
      <title>Margin of error</title>
      <p>
        The margin of error of a confidence interval is given by:
        <md>
          <mrow>\text{ critical value }  \ \times SE \text{ of estimate }</mrow>
        </md>
      </p>
      <p>
        The margin of error tells us with a given confidence level how far off we expect our point estimate to be from the true value.
      </p>
    </assemblage>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Suppose we are conducting a university survey to determine whether students support a $200 per year increase in fees to pay for a new football stadium.
          Find the smallest sample<nbsp/>size <m>n</m> so that the margin of error of the point estimate <m>\hat{p}</m> will be no larger than 0.04 when using a 95% confidence level.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <answer>
        <p>
          Because we are working with proportions,
          the critical value is a <m>z^{\star}</m> value.
          We want the margin of error to be less than or equal to 0.04, so we have:
          <md>
            <mrow>z^{\star}\times \sqrt{\frac{p(1-p)}{n}} \leq 0.04</mrow>
          </md>
        </p>
        <p>
          There are two unknowns in the inequality:
          <m>p</m> and <m>n</m>.
          If we have an estimate of <m>p</m>,
          perhaps from a similar survey, we could use that value.
          If we have no such estimate, we must use some other value for <m>p</m>.
          It turns out that the margin of error is largest when <m>p</m> is 0.5, so we typically use this
          <em>worst case estimate</em>
          of <m>p</m> = 0.5 if no other estimate is available.
          <md>

            <mrow>n=601</mrow>
          </md>
        </p>
        <p>
          The sample<nbsp/>size must be an integer and we round up because <m>n</m> must be greater than or equal to 600.25.
          We need at least 601 participants to ensure the sample proportion is within 0.04 of the true proportion with 95% confidence.

      No estimate of the true proportion is required in sample<nbsp/>size computations for a proportion.

        <p>
          (a) The alternative hypothesis,
          the one that bears the burden of proof,
          argues that Toohey has more than 50% support.
          Therefore, <m>H_A</m> will be one-sided and the null value will be <m>p_0 = 0.5</m>.
          So we have <m>H_0</m>: <m>p = 0.5</m> and <m>H_A</m>: <m>p > 0.5</m>.
          Note that the hypotheses are about a population parameter.
          The hypotheses are never about the sample.

          Because we assume that <m>p = p_0</m> for the calculations of the hypothesis test,
          we use the hypothesized value <m>p_0</m> rather than the sample value <m>\hat{p}</m> when verifying the success-failure condition.

    <p>
      In <xref ref="foundationsForInference">Chapter</xref>,
      we saw that the general form of the test statistic for a hypothesis test takes the following form:
      <md>
        <mrow>\text{ test statistic }  = \frac{\text{ point estimate }  - \text{ null value } }{SE \text{ of estimate } }</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      When the conditions for a normal model are met:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            We use Z as the test statistic and call the test a Z-test.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The point estimate is the sample proportion <m>\hat{p}</m>
            (just like for a confidence interval).
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Since we compute the test statistic assuming the null hypothesis
            (that <m>p = p_0</m>)
            is true, we compute the standard error of the sample proportion using the null value <m>p_0</m>.
            <md>
              <mrow>SE = \sqrt{\frac{p_0(1-p_0)}{n}}</mrow>

          (Continues previous example).
          Deborah Toohey's campaign manager claimed she has more than 50% support from the district's electorate.
          A newspaper poll finds that 52% of 500 likely voters who were sampled support Toohey.
          Does this provide convincing evidence for the claim by Toohey's manager at the 5% significance level?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution xml:id="TooheyInferenceExample">
        <p>
          We will use a one-sided test with the following hypotheses:
          <ul>
            <li>
              <title>invalidlabel</title>
              <p>
                <m>p = 0.5</m>.
                Toohey's support is 50%.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <title>invalidlabel</title>
              <p>
                <m>p > 0.5</m>.
                Toohey's manager is correct, and her support is higher than 50%.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          We will use a significance level of <m>\alpha = 0.05</m> for the test.
          We can compute the standard error as
          <md>
            <mrow>SE = \sqrt{\frac{\ p_0 (1 - p_0)\ }{n}} = \sqrt{\frac{\ 0.5 (1 - 0.5\ )}{500}} = 0.022</mrow>
          </md>
        </p>
        <p>
          The test statistic can be computed as:
          <md>
            <mrow>Z =  \frac{\text{ point estimate }  - \text{ null value } }{SE \text{ of estimate } } = \frac{0.52 - 0.50}{0.022} = 0.89</mrow>
          </md>
        </p>
        <p>
          Because the alternative hypothesis uses a greater than sign (<m>></m>),
          this is an upper-tail test.
          We find the area under the standard normal curve to the
          <em>right</em> of <m>Z=0.89</m>.
          A figure featuring the p-value is shown in <xref ref="pValueForCampaignManagerClaimOfMoreThan50PercentSupport">Figure</xref> as the shaded region.

    </figure>
    <p>
      Using a table or a calculator,
      we find the p-value is 0.19.
      This p-value of 0.19 is greater than <m>\alpha = 0.05</m>,
      so we do not reject <m>H_0</m>.
      That is, we do not have sufficient evidence to support Toohey's campaign manager's claims that she has more than 50% support within the district.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Based on the result above,

      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          No.
          In a hypothesis test we look for degrees of evidence
          <em>against</em> the null hypothesis.
          We cannot ever prove the null hypothesis directly.
          The value 0.5 is reasonable, but many other values are reasonable as well.
          There are many values that would not get rejected by this test.

          A Gallup poll conducted in March of 2016 found that 54% of respondents oppose nuclear energy.
          This was the first time since Gallup first asked the question in 1994 that a majority of respondents said they oppose nuclear energy.
          The survey was based on telephone interviews from a random sample of 1,019 adults in the United States.
          Does this poll provide evidence that greater than half of U.S. adults oppose nuclear energy?
          Carry out an appropriate test at the 0.10 significance level.

    <title>Section summary</title>
    <p>
      Most of the confidence interval procedures and hypothesis tests of this book involve:
      a <term>point estimate</term>,
      the <term>standard error</term> of the point estimate,
      and an assumption about the <term>shape of the sampling distribution</term> of the point estimate.
      In this section,
      we explore inference when the parameter of interest is a <em>proportion</em>.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          We use the sample proportion <m>\hat{p}</m> as the <em>point estimate</em>
          for the unknown population proportion <m>p</m>.
          The sampling distribution of <m>\hat{p}</m> is approximately normal when the success-failure condition is met and the observations are independent.
          The observations can generally be considered independent when the data is collected from a random sample or come from a stable,
          random process analogous to flipping a coin.
          When the sampling distribution of <m>\hat{p}</m> is normal,
          the standardized test statistic also follows a
          <term>normal</term> distribution.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          When verifying the success-failure condition and calculating the <m>SE</m>,
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              use the <em>sample</em> proportion <m>\hat{p}</m> for the confidence interval, but
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              use the <em>null/hypothesized</em>
              proportion <m>p_0</m> for the hypothesis test.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          When there is one sample and the parameter of interest is a single proportion:
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                Estimate <m>p</m> at the C% confidence level using a
                <term>1-proportion Z-interval</term>.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Test <m>H_0</m>:
                <m>p=p_0</m> at the <m>\alpha</m> significance level using a
                <term>1-proportion Z-test</term>.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The first condition for the one proportion Z-interval and Z-test is the same.
          The second one is different because of the use of the null proportion for the test.

              <p>
                Interval: <m>n\hat{p}\ge 10</m> and
                <m>n(1-\hat{p})\ge 10</m> (Make sure to plug in numbers Test:
                <m>np_0\ge 10</m> and <m>n(1-p_0)\ge 10</m> for <m>n</m> and <m>\hat{p}</m>,

          When the conditions are met,
          we calculate the confidence interval and the test statistic as follows.
          <ul>
            <li class="custom-list-style-type" label="">
              <p>
                Confidence interval:<nbsp/> <m>\text{ point estimate } \ \pm\ z^{\star} \times SE\ \text{ of estimate }</m>
              </p>
            </li>
            <li class="custom-list-style-type" label="">
              <p>
                Test statistic:
                <m>Z = \frac{\text{ point estimate } - \text{ null value } }{SE \text{ of estimate } }</m>
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
      </li>
      <li class="custom-list-style-type" label="">
        <p>
          Here the point estimate is the sample proportion <m>\hat{p}</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li class="custom-list-style-type" label="">
        <p>
          The <m>SE</m> of estimate is the <m>SE</m> of the sample proportion.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li class="custom-list-style-type" label="">
        <p>
          For an Interval, use:
          <m>SE = \sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})}{n}}</m>; for a Test, use:
          <m>SE = \sqrt{\frac{p_0(1-p_0)}{n}}</m>
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The <term>margin of error</term> (<m>ME</m>) for a one-sample confidence interval for a proportion is <m>z^{\star}\sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})}{n}}</m>,
          which is proportional to <m>\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          To find the <term>minimum sample<nbsp/>size</term>
          needed to estimate a proportion with a given confidence level and a given margin of error,
          <m>m</m>,
          set up an inequality of the form:
          <md>
            <mrow>z^{\star}\sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})}{n}}\lt m</mrow>
          </md>
          <m>z^{\star}</m> depends on the desired confidence level.
          Unless a particular proportion is given in the problem,
          use \mbox{<m>\hat{p}=0.5</m>.}   We solve for the sample<nbsp/>size <m>n</m>.
          The final answer should be an <em>integer</em>,
          since <m>n</m> refers to a number of people or things.
