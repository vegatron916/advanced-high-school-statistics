      <p>
        The mean age of the pennies from <xref ref="penniesAges">Exercise</xref>
        is 10.44 years with a standard deviation of 9.2 years.
        Using the Central Limit Theorem,
        calculate the means and standard deviations of the distribution of the mean from random samples of size 5, 30, and 100.
