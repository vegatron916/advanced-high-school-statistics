    <title>Smoking habits of UK residents, Part I</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        A survey was conducted to study the smoking habits of UK residents.
        The histograms below display the distributions of the number of cigarettes smoked on weekdays and weekends,
        and they exclude data from people who identified themselves as non-smokers.
        Describe the two distributions and compare them. \footfullcite{data:smoking} <image width="70%" source="images/smoking_amountHist.png" />

      <p>
        Workers at a particular mining site receive an average of 35 days paid vacation,
        which is lower than the national average.
        The manager of this plant is under pressure from a local union to increase the amount of paid time off.
        However, he does not want to give more days off to the workers because that would be costly.
        Instead he decides he should fire 10 employees in such a way as to raise the average number of days off that are reported by his employees.
        In order to achieve this goal,
        should he fire employees who have the most number of days off,
        least number of days off,
        or those who have about the average number of days off?

    <title>Air quality</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Daily air quality is measured by the air quality index (AQI) reported by the Environmental Protection Agency.
        This index reports the pollution level and what associated health effects might be a concern.
        The index is calculated for five major air pollutants regulated by the Clean Air Act and takes values from 0 to 300,
        where a higher value indicates lower air quality.
        AQI was reported for a sample of 91 days in 2011 in Durham, NC. The relative frequency histogram below shows the distribution of the AQI values on these days. \footfullcite{data:durhamAQI:2011}

    <statement>
      <p>
        The <em>midrange</em> of a distribution is defined as the average of the maximum and the minimum of that distribution.
        Is this statistic robust to outliers and extreme skew?

    <title>Commute times</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        The US census collects data on time it takes Americans to commute to work,
        among many other variables.
        The histogram below shows the distribution of average commute times in 3,142 US counties in 2017.
        Also shown below is a spatial intensity map of the same data.
