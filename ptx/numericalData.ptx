      How do we visualize and describe the distribution of household income for counties within the United States?
      What shape would the distribution have?
      What other features might be important to notice?
      In this section,
      we will explore techniques for summarizing numerical variables.
      We will apply these techniques using county-level data from the US Census Bureau,
      which was introduced in <xref ref="dataBasics">Section</xref>,
      and a new data set <c>email50</c>,
      that comprises information on a random sample of 50 emails.

      Sometimes researchers wish to see the relationship between two variables.
      When we talk of a relationship or an association between variables,
      we are interested in how one variable behaves as the other variable increases or decreases.
    </p>
    <p>
      A <term>scatterplot</term> provides a case-by-case view of data that illustrates the relationship between two numerical variables.
      A scatterplot is shown in <xref ref="email50LinesCharacters">Figure</xref>,
      illustrating the relationship between the number of line breaks (<c>line_breaks</c>) and number of characters (<c>num_char</c>) in emails for the <c>email50</c> data set.
      In any scatterplot, each point represents a single case.
      Since there are 50 cases in <c>email50</c>,
      there are 50 points in <xref ref="email50LinesCharacters">Figure</xref>.

      <statement>
        <p>
          A scatterplot requires <term>bivariate</term>,
          or <term>paired data</term>.
          What does paired data mean?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <answer>
        <p>
          We say observations are <em>paired</em>
          when the two observations correspond to the same case or individual.
          In unpaired data, there is no such correspondence.
          In our example the two observations correspond to a particular email.
        </p>
      </answer>
    </example>
    <p>
      The variable that is suspected to be the response variable is plotted on the vertical (y)<nbsp/>axis and the variable that is suspected to be the explanatory variable is plotted on the horizontal (x)<nbsp/>axis.
      In this example,
      the variables could be switched since either variable could reasonably serve as the explanatory variable or the response variable.
    </p>

      <title>Drawing scatterplots</title>
      <p>
        (1)<nbsp/>Decide which variable should go on each axis,
        and draw and label the two axes.
      </p>
      <p>
        (2)<nbsp/>Note the range of each variable,
        and add tick marks and scales to each<nbsp/>axis.
      </p>
      <p>
        (3)<nbsp/>Plot the dots as you would on an (<m>x, y</m>) coordinate plane.
      </p>
    </assemblage>
    <p>
      The association between two variables can be
      <em>positive</em><idx><h>positive association|textbf</h></idx> or <em>negative</em>,
          <idx><h>negative association|textbf</h></idx>
      or there can be no association.
      Positive association means that larger values of the first variable are associated with larger values of the second variable.
      Additionally,
      the association can follow a linear trend or a curved (nonlinear) trend.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          What would it mean for two variables to have a
          <em>negative</em> association?
          What about <em>no</em> association?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <answer>
        <p>
          Negative association implies that larger values of the first variable are associated with smaller values of the second variable.
          No association implies that the values of the second variable tend to be independent of changes in the first variable.

      </statement>
      <answer>
        <p>
          The relationship is evidently <term>nonlinear</term>,
          as highlighted by the dashed line.
          This is different from previous scatterplots we've seen,
          which show relationships that do not show much,
          if any, curvature in the trend.
          There is also a negative association,
          as higher rates of poverty tend to be associated with lower median household income.

          Answers may vary.
          Scatterplots are helpful in quickly spotting associations relating variables,
          whether those associations come in the form of simple trends or whether those relationships are more complex.

          and your horizontal axis represents something that is only good in moderation.
          Health and water consumption fit this description:
          we require some water to survive,
          but consume too much and it becomes toxic and can kill a person.
          If health was represented on the vertical axis and water consumption on the horizontal axis,
          then we would create a <m>\cap</m><nbsp/>shape.

      Sometimes two variables is one too many:
      only one variable may be of interest.
      In these cases we want to focus not on the association between two variables,
      but on the distribution of a single,
      or <term>univariate</term>, variable.
      The term <term>distribution</term>
      refers to the values that a variable takes and the frequency of these values.
      Here we introduce a new data set,
      the <c>email50</c> data set.
      This data set contains the number of characters in 50 emails.
      To simplify the data,
      we will round the numbers and record the values in thousands.
      Thus, 22105 is recorded as 22.

      Rather than look at the data as a list of numbers,
      which makes the distribution difficult to discern,
      we will organize it into a table called a
      <term>stem-and-leaf plot</term>
      shown in <xref ref="stemandleafemail50">Figure</xref>.
      In a stem-and-leaf plot, each number is broken into two parts.
      The first part is called the <term>stem</term>
      and consists of the beginning digit(s).
      The second part is called the <term>leaf</term>
      and consists of the final digit(s).
      The stems are written in a column in ascending order,
      and the leaves that match up with those stems are written on the corresponding row.
      <xref ref="stemandleafemail50">Figure</xref>
      shows a stem-and-leaf plot of the number of characters in 50 emails.
      The stem represents the ten thousands place and the leaf represents the thousands place.
      For example, <c>1  |  2</c> corresponds to 12 thousand.
      When making a stem-and-leaf plot,
      remember to include a legend that describes what the stem and what the leaf represent.
      Without this,
      there is no way of knowing if 1 <m>|</m> 2 represents 1.2, 12, 120, 1200, etc.

      Another simple graph for univariate numerical data is a dot plot.
      A<nbsp/><term>dot plot</term> uses dots to show the <term>frequency</term>,
      or number of occurrences, of the values in a data set.
      The higher the stack of dots,
      the greater the number occurrences there are of the corresponding value.
      An example using the same data set,
      number of characters from 50 emails,

      These graphs make it easy to observe important features of the data,
      such as the location of clusters and presence of gaps.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Based on both the stem-and-leaf and dot plot,
          where are the values clustered and where are the gaps for the <c>email50</c> data set?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <answer>
        <p>
          There is a large cluster in the 0 to less than 20 thousand range,
          with a peak around 1 thousand.
          There are gaps between 30 and 40 thousand and between the two values in the 40 thousands and the largest value of approximately 64 thousand.

      Additionally,
      we can easily identify any observations that appear to be unusually distant from the rest of the data.
      Unusually distant observations are called <em>outliers</em>.
          <idx><h>outlier|textbf</h></idx>
      Later in this chapter we will provide numerical rules of thumb for identifying outliers.
      For now, it is sufficient to identify them by observing gaps in the graph.
      In this case,
      it would be reasonable to classify the emails with character counts of 42 thousand, 43 thousand,
      and 64 thousand as outliers since they are numerically distant from most of the data.

          Consider a data set that consists of the following numbers: 12, 12, 12, 12, 12, 13, 13, 14, 14, 15, 19.
          Which graph would better illustrate the data:
          a stem-and-leaf plot or a dot plot?
          Explain.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <answer>
        <p>
          Because all the values begin with 1, there would be only one stem
          (or two in a split stem-and-leaf).
          This would not provide a good sense of the distribution.
          For example,
          the gap between 15 and 19 would not be visually apparent.
          A dot plot would be better here.

      Stem-and-leaf plots and dot plots are ideal for displaying data from small samples because they show the exact values of the observations and how frequently they occur.
      However, they are impractical for larger samples.
      For larger samples, rather than showing the frequency of every value,
      we prefer to think of the value as belonging to a <em>bin</em>.
      For example,
      in the <c>email50</c> data set,
      we create a table of counts for the number of cases with character counts between 0 and 5,000,
      then the number of cases between 5,000 and 10,000, and so on.
      Such a table,
      shown in <xref ref="binnedNumCharTable">Figure</xref>,
      is called a <term>frequency table</term>.
      Bins usually include the observations that fall on their left (lower) boundary and exclude observations that fall on their right (upper) boundary.
      This is called <em>left inclusive</em>.
      For example, 5 (i.e. 5000) would be counted in the 5-10 bin,
      not in the 0-5 bin.
      These binned counts are plotted as bars in <xref ref="email50NumCharHist">Figure</xref>
      into what is called a <term>histogram</term>
      or <term>frequency histogram</term>,
      which resembles the stacked dot plot shown in <xref ref="emailCharactersDotPlotStacked">Figure</xref>.

        1. The variable is always placed on the horizontal axis.
        Before drawing the histogram,
        label both axes and draw a scale for each.
      </p>
      <p>
        2. Draw bars such that the height of the bar is the frequency of that bin and the width of the bar corresponds to the bin width.

      Histograms provide a view of the
      <term>data density</term>.
      Higher bars represent where the data are relatively more common.
      For instance,
      there are many more emails between 0 and 10,000 characters than emails between 10,000 and 20,000 in the data set.
      The bars make it easy to see how the density of the data changes relative to the number of characters.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          How many emails had fewer than 10 thousand characters?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          The height of the bars corresponds to frequency.
          There were 19 cases from 0 to less than 5 thousand and 12 cases from 5 thousand to less than 10 thousand,
          so there were <m>19+12=31</m> emails with fewer than 10 thousand characters.
        </p>
      </solution>
    </example>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Approximately how many emails had fewer than 1 thousand chacters?

      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          Based just on this histogram,
          we cannot know the exact answer to this question.
          We only know that 19 emails had between 0 and 5 thousand characters.
          If the number of emails is evenly distribution on this interval,
          then we can estimate that approximately 19/5<nbsp/><m>\approx</m> 4 emails fell in the range between 0 and 1 thousand.

      </statement>
      <answer>
        <p>
          From the first example,
          we know that 31 emails had fewer than 10 thousand characters.
          Since there are 50 emails in total,
          there must be 19 emails that have 10 thousand or more characters.
          To find the percent, compute <m>19/50 = 0.38 = 38\%</m>.

      Sometimes questions such as the previous ones can be answered more easily with a
      <term>cumulative frequency histogram</term>.
      This type of histogram shows cumulative, or total,
      frequency achieved by each bin,
      rather than the frequency in that particular bin.

          By tracing the height of the 15-20 thousand bin over to the vertical axis,

          Therefore, we estimate that <m>\approx</m>39 of the emails had fewer than 30 thousand characters.
          Note that, unlike with a regular frequency histogram,

      <solution>
        <p>
          To answer this question, we do a subtraction.
          <m>\approx</m>39 had fewer than 15-20 thousand emails and <m>\approx</m>37 had fewer than 10-15 thousand emails,

      <solution>
        <p>
          This time we are given a cumulative frequency,
          so we start at 25 on the vertical axis and trace it across to see which bin it hits.
          It hits the 5-10 thousand bin,
          so 25 of the emails had fewer than a value somewhere between 5 and 10 thousand characters.
        </p>
      </solution>
    </example>
    <p>
      Knowing that 25 of the emails had fewer than a value between 5 and 10 thousand characters is useful information,
      but it is even more useful if we know what percent of the total 25 represents.
      Knowing that there were 50 total emails tells us that
      <m>25 / 50 = 0.5 = 50\%</m> of the emails had fewer than a value between 5 and 10 thousand characters.
      When we want to know what fraction or percent of the data meet a certain criteria,
      we use relative frequency instead of frequency.
      <em>Relative frequency</em><idx><h>relative frequency|textbf</h></idx> is a fancy term for percent or proportion.
      It tells us how large a number is relative to the total.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just as we constructed a frequency table, frequency histogram,
      and cumulative frequency histogram,
      we can construct a relative frequency table,
      relative frequency histogram,

          The shape will remain exactly the same.
          Changing from frequency to relative frequency involves dividing all the frequencies by the same number,
          so only the vertical scale
          (the numbers on the y-axis)
          change.

      </statement>
      <answer>
        <p>
          We suspect most households would have 0, 1, or 2 pets but that a smaller number of households will have 3, 4, 5, or more pets,
          so there will be greater density over the small numbers,

      In addition to looking at whether a distribution is skewed or symmetric,
      histograms,
      stem-and-leaf plots, and dot plots can be used to identify modes.
      A <term>mode</term> is represented by a prominent peak in the distribution.<fn>
      Another definition of mode,
      which is not typically used in statistics,
      is the value with the most occurrences.
      It is common to have <em>no</em>
      observations with the same value in a data set,

          How many modes would you anticipate in this height data set?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <answer>
        <p>
          There might be two height groups visible in the data set:
          one of the students and one of the adults.
          That is, the data are probably bimodal.

      <title>Looking for modes</title>
      <p>
        Looking for modes isn't about finding a clear and correct answer about the number of modes in a distribution,
        which is why <em>prominent</em>
        is not rigorously defined in this book.
        The important part of this examination is to better understand your data and how it might be structured.

    <title>Descriptive versus inferential statistics</title>
    <p>
      Finally, we note that the graphical summaries of this section and the numerical summaries of the next section fall into the realm of
      <term>descriptive statistics</term>.
      Descriptive statistics is about describing or summarizing data;
      it does not attribute properties of the data to a larger population.
      <em>Inferential statistics</em>,
          <idx><h>inferential statistics|textbf</h></idx>
      on the other hand,
      uses samples to generalize or to infer something about a larger population.
      We will have to wait until Chapter<nbsp/>5 to enter the exciting world of inferential statistics.

        <p>
          A <term>scatterplot</term> is a <term>bivariate</term>
          display illustrating the relationship between two numerical variables.
          The observations must be <term>paired</term>,
          which is to say that they correspond to the same case or individual.
          The linear association between two variables can be positive or negative,
          or there can be no association.
          <em>Positive association</em><idx><h>positive association|textbf</h></idx> means that larger values of the first variable are associated with larger values of the second variable.
          <em>Negative association</em><idx><h>negative association|textbf</h></idx> means that larger values of the first variable are associated with smaller values of the second variable.
          Additionally,
          the association can follow a linear trend or a curved (nonlinear) trend.

          When looking at a <term>univariate</term> display,
          researchers want to understand the distribution of the variable.
          The term <term>distribution</term>
          refers to the values that a variable takes and the frequency of those values.
          When looking at a distribution,
          note the presence of clusters,
          gaps, and <em>outliers</em>.

          Distributions may be <term>symmetric</term>
          or they may have a long tail.
          If a distribution has a long left tail
          (with greater density over the higher numbers),
          it is <term>left skewed</term>.
          If a distribution has a long right tail
          (with greater density over the smaller numbers),
          it is <term>right skewed</term>.

          Two graphs that are useful for showing the distribution of a small number of observations are the
          <term>stem-and-leaf plot</term>
          and <term>dot plot</term>.
          These graphs are ideal for displaying data from small samples because they show the exact values of the observations and how frequently they occur.
          However, they are impractical for larger data sets.

      <li>
        <p>
          For larger data sets it is common to use a
          <term>frequency histogram</term>
          or a <term>relative frequency histogram</term>
          to display the distribution of a variable.
          This requires choosing bins of an appropriate width.

          To see cumulative amounts, use a
          <term>cumulative frequency histogram</term>.
          A <term>cumulative relative frequency histogram</term>
          is ideal for showing <em>percentiles</em>.
