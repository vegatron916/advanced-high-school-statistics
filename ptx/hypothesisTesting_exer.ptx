              A tutoring company would like to understand if most students tend to improve their grades
              (or not)
              after they use their services.
              They sample 200 of the students who used their service in the past year and ask them if their grades have improved or declined from the previous year.

              Employers at a firm are worried about the effect of March Madness,
              a basketball championship held each spring in the US, on employee productivity.
              They estimate that on a regular business day employees spend on average 15 minutes of company time checking personal email,
              making personal phone calls, etc.
              They also collect data on how much company time employees spend on such non-business activities during March Madness.
              They want to determine if these data provide convincing evidence that employee productivity changed during March Madness.

              Since 2008, chain restaurants in California have been required to display calorie counts of each menu item.
              Prior to menus displaying calorie counts,
              the average calorie intake of diners at a restaurant was 1100 calories.
              After calorie counts started to be displayed on menus,
              a nutritionist collected data on the number of calories consumed at this restaurant from a random sample of diners.
              Do these data provide convincing evidence of a difference in the average calorie intake of a diners at this restaurant?

              they conduct a random sample of 852 residents and ask them about their alcohol consumption.
