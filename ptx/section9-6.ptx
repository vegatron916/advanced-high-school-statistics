    <title>Beer and blood alcohol content</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Many people believe that gender, weight, drinking habits,
        and many other factors are much more important in predicting blood alcohol content (BAC) than simply considering the number of drinks a person consumed.
        Here we examine data from sixteen student volunteers at Ohio State University who each drank a randomly assigned number of cans of beer.
        These students were different genders,
        and they differed in weight and drinking habits.
        Thirty minutes later,
        a police officer measured their blood alcohol content (BAC) in grams of alcohol per deciliter of blood. \footfullcite{Malkevitc+Lesser:2008} The scatterplot and regression table summarize the findings.

    <statement>
      <p>
        Is the gestational age
        (time between conception and birth)
        of a low birth-weight baby useful in predicting head circumference at birth?
        Twenty-five low birth-weight babies were studied at a Harvard teaching hospital;
        the investigators calculated the regression of head circumference
        (measured in centimeters)
        against gestational age
        (measured in weeks).
        The estimated regression line is
        <me>
          \widehat{head~circumference} = 3.91 + 0.78 \times gestational~age

            <p>
