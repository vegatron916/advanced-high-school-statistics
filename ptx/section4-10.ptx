        At a university, 13% of students smoke.

              The university gym opens at 9 am on Saturday mornings.
              One Saturday morning at 8:55 am there are 27 students outside the gym waiting for it to open.
              Should you use the same approach from part (a) to calculate the expected number of smokers among these 27 students?

        Consider the following card game with a well-shuffled deck of cards.
        If you draw a red card, you win nothing.
        If you get a spade, you win $5.
        For any club,
        you win $10 plus an extra $20 for the ace of clubs.

        { <em>Is it worth it ?</em>} Andy is always looking for ways to make money fast.
        Lately, he has been trying to make money by gambling.
        Here is the game he is considering playing: The game costs $2 to play.
        He draws a card from a deck.
        If he gets a number card (2-10), he wins nothing.
        For any face card ( jack, queen or king), he wins $3.
        For any ace, he wins $5, and he wins an <em>extra</em>
        $20 if he draws the ace of clubs.

    <title>American roulette</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        The game of American roulette involves spinning a wheel with 38 slots: 18 red, 18 black,
        and 2 green.
        A ball is spun onto the wheel and will eventually land in a slot,
        where each slot has an equal chance of capturing the ball.
        Gamblers can place bets on red or black.
        If the ball lands on their color, they double their money.
        If it lands on another color, they lose their money.
        Suppose you bet $1 on red.
