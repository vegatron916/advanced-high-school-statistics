        introduces a study where researchers collected data to examine the relationship between air pollutants and preterm births in Southern California.
        During the study air pollution levels were measured by air quality monitoring stations.
        Length of gestation data were collected on 143,196 births between the years 1989 and 1993,
        and air pollution exposure during gestation was calculated for each birth.

        <xref ref="study_components_cheaters">Exercise</xref>
        introduces a study where researchers studying the relationship between honesty, age,
        and self-control conducted an experiment on 160 children between the ages of 5 and 15.
        The researchers asked each child to toss a fair coin in private and to record the outcome
        (white or black)
        on a paper sheet,
        and said they would only reward children who report white.
        Half the students were explicitly told not to cheat and the others were not given any explicit instructions.
        Differences were observed in the cheating rates in the instruction and no instruction groups,
        as well as some differences across children's characteristics within each group.

        introduces a study on using the Buteyko shallow breathing technique to reduce asthma symptoms and improve quality of life.
        As part of this study 600 asthma patients aged 18-69 who relied on medication for asthma treatment were recruited and randomly assigned to two groups:
        one practiced the Buteyko method and the other did not.
        Those in the Buteyko group experienced, on average,
        a significant reduction in asthma symptoms and an improvement in quality of life.

        introduces a study on the relationship between socio-economic class and unethical behavior.
        As part of this study 129 University of California Berkeley undergraduates were asked to identify themselves as having low or high social-class by comparing themselves to others with the most (least) money,
        most (least) education, and most (least) respected jobs.
        They were also presented with a jar of individually wrapped candies and informed that the candies were for children in a nearby laboratory,
        but that they could take some if they wanted.
        After completing some unrelated tasks,
        participants reported the number of candies they had taken.
        It was found that those who were identified as upper-class took more candy than others.

    <title>Relaxing after work</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        The General Social Survey asked the question, ``After an average work day,
        about how many hours do you have to relax or pursue activities that you enjoy?" to a random sample of 1,155 Americans.
        The average relaxing time was found to be 1.65 hours.
        Determine which of the following is an observation,
        a variable, a sample statistic
        (value calculated based on the observed sample),
        or a population parameter.

    <title>Cats on YouTube</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Suppose you want to estimate the percentage of videos on YouTube that are cat videos.
        It is impossible for you to watch all videos on YouTube so you use a random video picker to select 1000 videos for you.
        You find that 2% of these videos are cat videos.Determine which of the following is an observation,
        a variable, a sample statistic
        (value calculated based on the observed sample),
        or a population parameter.
        <ol>
