    <title>With and without replacement</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        In the following situations assume that half of the specified population is male and the other half is female.
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              Suppose you're sampling from a room with 10 people.
              What is the probability of sampling two females in a row when sampling with replacement?
              What is the probability when sampling without replacement?
            </p>

          <li>
            <p>
              Now suppose you're sampling from a stadium with 10,000 people.
              What is the probability of sampling two females in a row when sampling with replacement?
              What is the probability when sampling without replacement?

              We often treat individuals who are sampled from a large population as independent.
              Using your findings from parts<nbsp/>(a) and<nbsp/>(b),
              explain whether or not this assumption is reasonable.

    <title>Eye color, Part I</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        A husband and wife both have brown eyes but carry genes that make it possible for their children to have brown eyes (probability 0.75),
        blue eyes (0.125), or green eyes (0.125).
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              What is the probability the first blue-eyed child they have is their third child?
              Assume that the eye colors of the children are independent of each other.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              On average, how many children would such a pair of parents have before having a blue-eyed child?
              What is the standard deviation of the number of children they would expect to have until the first blue-eyed child?

    <title>Defective rate</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        A machine that produces a special type of transistor (a component of computers) has a 2% defective rate.
        The production is considered a random process where each transistor is independent of the others.
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              What is the probability that the <m>10^{th}</m> transistor produced is the first with a defect?

          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              What is the probability that the machine produces no defective transistors in a batch of 100?
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              On average, how many transistors would you expect to be produced before the first with a defect?
              What is the standard deviation?
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Another machine that also produces transistors has a 5% defective rate where each transistor is produced independent of the others.
              On average how many transistors would you expect to be produced with this machine before the first with a defect?
              What is the standard deviation?

              how does increasing the probability of an event affect the mean and standard deviation of the wait time until success?

    <title>Bernoulli, the mean</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Use the probability rules from <xref ref="randomVariablesSection">Section</xref>
        to derive the mean of a Bernoulli random variable,
        i.e. a random variable <m>X</m> that takes value 1 with probability <m>p</m> and value 0 with probability <m>1 - p</m>.
        That is, compute the expected value of a generic Bernoulli random variable.
