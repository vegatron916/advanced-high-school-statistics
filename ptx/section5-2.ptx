      <p>
        In triathlons,
        it is common for racers to be placed into age and gender groups.
        Friends Leo and Mary both completed the Hermosa Beach Triathlon,
        where Leo competed in the <em>Men, Ages 30 - 34</em>
        group while Mary competed in the
        <em>Women, Ages 25 - 29</em> group.
        Leo completed the race in 1:22:28 (4948 seconds),
        while Mary completed the race in 1:31:53 (5513 seconds).
        Obviously Leo finished faster,
        but they are curious about how they did within their respective groups.
        Can you help them?
        Here is some information on the performance of their groups:

    <statement>
      <p>
        Suppose a restaurant is running a promotion where prices of menu items are random following some underlying distribution.
        If you're lucky,
        you can get a basket of fries for $3, or if you're not so lucky you might end up having to pay $10 for the same menu item.
        The price of basket of fries is drawn from a normal distribution with mean $6 and standard deviation of $2.
        The price of a fountain drink is drawn from a normal distribution with mean $3 and standard deviation of $1.
        What is the probability that you pay more than $10 for a dinner consisting of a basket of fries and a fountain drink?
