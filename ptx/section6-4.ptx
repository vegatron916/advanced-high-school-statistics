    <statement>
      <p>
        In 2013, the Pew Research Foundation reported that
        <q>45% of U.S. adults report that they live with one or more chronic conditions</q>. \footfullcite{data:pewdiagnosis:2013} However,
        this value was based on a sample,
        so it may not be a perfect estimate for the population parameter of interest on its own.
        The study reported a standard error of about 1.2%, and a normal model may reasonably be used in this setting.
        Create a 95% confidence interval for the proportion of U.S. adults who live with one or more chronic conditions.
        Also interpret the confidence interval in the context of the study.

    <statement>
      <p>
        A poll conducted in 2013 found that 52% of U.S. adult Twitter users get at least some news on Twitter.\footfullcite{data:pewtwitternews:2013}. The standard error for this estimate was 2.4%, and a normal distribution may be used to model the sample proportion.
        Construct a 99% confidence interval for the fraction of U.S. adult Twitter users who get some news on Twitter,
        and interpret the confidence interval in context.

              We can say with certainty that the confidence interval from <xref ref="chronic_illness_intro">Exercise</xref>

              If we repeated this study 1,000 times and constructed a 95% confidence interval for each study,
              then approximately 950 of those confidence intervals would contain the true fraction of U.S. adults who suffer from chronic illnesses.

    <title>Waiting at an ER, Part I</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        A hospital administrator hoping to improve wait times decides to estimate the average emergency room waiting time at her hospital.
        She collects a simple random sample of 64 patients and determines the time
        (in minutes)
        between when they checked in to the ER until they were first seen by a doctor.
        A 95% confidence interval based on this sample is (128 minutes, 147 minutes),
        which is based on the normal model for the mean.
        Determine whether the following statements are true or false,
        and explain your reasoning.
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              We are 95% confident that the average waiting time of these 64 emergency room patients is between 128 and 147 minutes.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              We are 95% confident that the average waiting time of all patients at this hospital's emergency room is between 128 and 147 minutes.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              95% of random samples have a sample mean between 128 and 147 minutes.

          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              A 99% confidence interval would be narrower than the 95% confidence interval since we need to be more sure of our estimate.

          <li>
            <p>
              The margin of error is 9.5 and the sample mean is 137.5.

              In order to decrease the margin of error of a 95% confidence interval to half of what it is now,
              we would need to double the sample size.

    <title>Mental health</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        The General Social Survey asked the question: ``For how many days during the past 30 days was your mental health,
        which includes stress, depression,
        and problems with emotions,
        not good?" Based on responses from 1,151 US residents,
        the survey reported a 95% confidence interval of 3.40 to 4.24 days in 2010.
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              Interpret this interval in context of the data.

              What does
              <q>95% confident</q>
              mean?
              Explain in the context of the application.

              Suppose the researchers think a 99% confidence level would be more appropriate for this interval.
              Will this new interval be smaller or wider than the 95% confidence interval?

            <p>
              If a new survey were to be done with 500 Americans,
              do you think the standard error of the estimate be larger,
              smaller, or about the same.
