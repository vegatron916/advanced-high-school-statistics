    <title>Course satisfaction across sections</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        A large college class has 160 students.
        All 160 students attend the lectures together,
        but the students are divided into 4 groups, each of 40 students,
        for lab sections administered by different teaching assistants.
        The professor wants to conduct a survey about how satisfied the students are with the course,
        and he believes that the lab section a student is in might affect the student's overall satisfaction with the course.

        The Gallup Poll uses a procedure called random digit dialing,

      <p>
        A study published in the <em>Journal of Personality and Social Psychology</em>
        asked a group of 200 randomly sampled men and women to evaluate how they felt about various subjects,
        such as camping, health care,
        architecture, taxidermy, crossword puzzles,
        and Japan in order to measure their dispositional attitude towards mostly independent stimuli.
        Then, they presented the participants with information about a new product:
        a microwave oven.
        This microwave oven does not exist,
        but the participants didn't know this,
        and were given three positive and three negative fake reviews.
        People who reacted positively to the subjects on the dispositional attitude measurement also tended to react positively to the microwave oven,
        and those who reacted negatively also tended to react negatively to it.
        Researchers concluded that ``some people tend to like things,
        whereas others tend to dislike things,
        and a more thorough understanding of this tendency will lead to a more thorough understanding of the psychology of attitudes." \footfullcite{Hepler:2013}

        Below are excerpts from two articles published in the <em>NY Times</em>:
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              An article titled <em>Risks: Smokers Found More Prone to Dementia</em>
              states the following: \footfullcite{news:smokingDementia} { ``Researchers analyzed data from 23,123 health plan members who participated in a voluntary exam and health behavior survey from 1978 to 1985,
              when they were 50-60 years old. 23 years later,
              about 25% of the group had dementia,
              including 1,136 with Alzheimer's disease and 416 with vascular dementia.
              After adjusting for other factors,
              the researchers concluded that pack-a-day smokers were 37% more likely than nonsmokers to develop dementia,
              and the risks went up with increased smoking; 44% for one to two packs a day;
              and twice the risk for more than two packs."} Based on this study,
              can we conclude that smoking causes dementia later in life?
              Explain your reasoning.

              Another article titled <em>The School Bully Is Sleepy</em>
              states the following: \footfullcite{news:bullySleep} { ``The University of Michigan study,
              collected survey data from parents on each child's sleep habits and asked both parents and teachers to assess behavioral concerns.
              About a third of the students studied were identified by parents or teachers as having problems with disruptive behavior or bullying.
              The researchers found that children who had behavioral issues and those who were identified as bullies were twice as likely to have shown symptoms of sleep disorders."} A friend of yours who read the article says, ``The study shows that sleep disorders lead to bullying in school children." Is this statement justified?
              If not, how best can you describe the conclusion that can be drawn from this study?
